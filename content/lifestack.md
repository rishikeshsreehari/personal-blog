This page is an attempt to document the tools, apps, gadgets, gear, and other stuff I use regularly. This is quite an extensive list, and I've tried my best to categorize them to the best of my abilities. Everything listed on this page is what I use. The things I no longer use are moved to the Graveyard section at the bottom with justification. Some of the links below contain affiliate tags that allow me to earn some income if you make purchases using the links. It does not cost you anything extra and supports my work. If you have any better suggestions for the items listed below, please let me know.

A list of things that I plan to buy in the future can be found on the 'Future Stack' page.

## Gadgets

**Computer**: I use an 6-year old [Asus Zenbook UX310UQ](https://www.asus.com/in/commercial-laptops/asus-zenbook-ux310uq) as my personal computer. It is quite old, but hasn't lagged much. I might upgrade to a Macbook sometime in next 2 years. I do not use any external mouse or other accessories with my laptop.

**Smartphone**:My 5.4 inch [iPhone 13 Mini](https://geni.us/rsh-13-mini) is the greatest phone I've ever owned. It's small, light, compact, yet powerful. It's such a shame that Apple and other manufactures have stopped making compact phones. It has served me great and I wish it lasted forever. Since the battery on this phone is not that great, I also use an [Ambrane 20,000mAh powerbank](https://geni.us/rsh-ambrane-20000) along with it.

**E-Reader**: I own a [Kindle Paperwhite 2017](https://geni.us/rsh-kindle-paperwhite) edition and it's unarguable the best purchase of my life. I use it before going to bed, while traveling, during hikes, toilet and everywhere you can imagine. It has survived well over the years and have zero complaints. Paired with a [ReadWise account](https://readwise.io/rishikesh/), all my highlights from books are synced the cloud and I get an email everyday morning with 10 highlights from Readwise. If you are into e-books, then definitely checkout [Readwise(Free!)](https://readwise.io/rishikesh/).


**Audio**: In terms of Audio, I recently purchased [Oneplus's Nord Buds 2](https://geni.us/rsh-nord-buds-2), that are great value for money with ANC upto 25 dB, but not the best. Apart from these, I use the classic [Apple wired EarPods](https://geni.us/rsh-earpods)with lightning connector. They sound awesome for the price and even with couple of accidental washes, they still work fine. The only downside is how messy they tangle while in pocket or in bag. I also use a pair of Anker Soundcore neckband headphones while running & cycling. They sound terrible and I'm looking for an alternative.

**Camera**: I also own a [Canon 700D/Rebel T5i](https://geni.us/rsh-700d) crop sensor DSLR camera since 2015. I pair it with a [Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM] or a [Canon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM Lens](https://geni.us/rsh-canon-24mm). These are great prime lenses and I love the extra sharpness and the creatve limitness due to the lack of zoom.  It also came with an [EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II](https://geni.us/rsh-canon-18-55) and [EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6](https://geni.us/rsh-canon-55-250) lenses, but I rarely use them as the lenses have aged and I prefer prime lenses over zoom.


## Fitness

**Fitness Tracker**: I use [Amazfit T-Rex Pro](https://geni.us/rsh-trex-pro) as my fitness tracker. It tracks my cycling, running and swimming workouts. The accuracy is pretty decent for the price and heart rate values are comparable to Apple Watch. It's rugged and battery life is awesome. The only downside for me is that it doesn't measure heart rate while swimming and also doesn't allow to pair any external sensors.

**Cycling**: I've been using a [Triban RC 100](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8810364/road-bikes/road-bike-triban-rc100-drop-bar?id=8810364&type=p) road bike for last 2 years now. It's a decent bike and I've clocked close to 10,000 kms so far. The one I have does not have drop bar shifters and came with 1x7 configuration. I've upgraded the bike with a [Shimano FC-R2000 Claris Crankset](https://bumsonthesaddle.com/products/shimano-fc-r2000-claris-double-crankset-8-speed) and a [Shimano Claris Front Derailleur](https://www.cyclop.in/products/shimano-claris-front-derailleur). I wear these [Endura Xtract Gel Shorts II](https://www.endurasport.com/xtract-gel-short-ii-black/12926408.html) for my long rides and I've wore them over 400kms in one-go. I also use these [Endura Aerogel Mitt](https://www.endurasport.com/fs260-pro-aerogel-mitt-navy/12929042.html) gloves for long endurance rides. I use these these [CateEye Omni 5](https://geni.us/rsh-cateye-omni5) rear LEDs that are battery powered and also these rechargable [cheap front lights](https://geni.us/rsh-bike-front-light) that can be charged using a power bank. For lubing the chain, I use [Squirt Lube](https://geni.us/rsh-squirt-lube), for punctures on the go, I use the [Park Tool's VP-1](https://geni.us/rsh-park-tool-vp1) patch kit alongwith the [Giyo GM-71 Hand Pump](https://www.cyclop.in/products/giyo-gm-71-pump). All other accessories like spare tubes, multitool, bags, jerseys,helmet,rain covers etc are from Decathlon.


**Running**: My primary running shoe is [Hoka Mach 5](https://geni.us/rsh-hoka-mach5). These are great shoes as they offer quite cushioning and are light. I also own a pair of [Hoka Rinon 3](https://geni.us/rsh-hoka-rincon3). I bought since I got it at a very good deal. These are not as premium as the Mach 5, but still very light and fast. I use [these](https://www.decathlon.com/collections/running-shorts/products/running-breathable-shorts-dry-333374) and [these](https://www.decathlon.com/collections/running-shorts/products/running-lightweight-shorts-dry-119678) pair of shorts by Decathlon for running. My training app of choice for running is [TrainAsOne](https://trainasone.com/), an AI based training app that adapts with your performance. 

**Nutrition**: I do not take much supplements apart from whey Protein and fish oil. For whey protein, I prefer N[utrabox 100% Whey Protein](https://nutrabox.in/products/flavoured-whey-protein-with-dha-mct) as it has performed well in multiple [tests](https://twitter.com/theliverdr/status/1629670100595888128?lang=en). I also take [Swisse High Strength Odourless Wild Fish Oil](https://geni.us/rsh-swisse-fish-oil) as a supplement since I feel that my fish intake has been low ever since I moved to Delhi. I'm not 100% convinced on its benefits, but you can read some studies on it [here](https://examine.com/supplements/fish-oil/).
