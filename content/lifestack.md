This page is an attempt to document the tools, apps, gadgets, gear, and other stuff I use regularly. This is quite an extensive list, and I've tried my best to categorize them to the best of my abilities. Everything listed on this page is what I use. The things I no longer use are moved to the Graveyard section at the bottom with justification. Some of the links below contain affiliate tags that allow me to earn some income if you make purchases using the links. It does not cost you anything extra and supports my work. If you have any better suggestions for the items listed below, please let me know.

A list of things that I plan to buy in the future can be found on the ['Future Stack'](/futurestack/) page.

## üìüGadgets

**üíª Computer**: I recently upgraded to a [MacBook Pro M4 Pro](https://www.apple.com/ae/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-m4) with 24GB RAM and 512GB storage, and I've loved it so far. It's a significant upgrade from my previous 8-year-old [Asus Zenbook UX310UQ](https://www.asus.com/bt/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-ux310uq/). I use a [Logitech MX Master 3S](https://geni.us/rs-mx-3s) as my mouse. Claude Sonnet is my preferred AI model and I prefer chatting with it directly over using AI assistants like Cursor. For development, I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) as my terminal and VS Code as my IDE.

**üì± Smartphone**:My 5.4 inch [iPhone 13 Mini](https://geni.us/rsh-13-mini) is the greatest phone I've ever owned. It's small, light, compact, yet powerful. It's such a shame that Apple and other manufactures have stopped making compact phones. It has served me great and I wish it lasted forever. Since the battery on this phone is not that great, I also use an [Ambrane 20,000mAh powerbank](https://geni.us/rsh-ambrane-20000) along with it.

**üìñ E-Reader**: I own a [Kindle Paperwhite 2017](https://geni.us/rsh-kindle-paperwhite) edition and it's unarguable the best purchase of my life. I use it before going to bed, while traveling, during hikes, toilet and everywhere you can imagine. It has survived well over the years and have zero complaints. Paired with a [ReadWise account](https://readwise.io/rishikesh/), all my highlights from books are synced the cloud and I get an email everyday morning with 10 highlights from Readwise. If you are into e-books, then definitely checkout [Readwise(Free!)](https://readwise.io/rishikesh/).


**üéß Audio**: In terms of Audio, I recently purchased [Oneplus's Nord Buds 2](https://geni.us/rsh-nord-buds-2), that are great value for money with ANC upto 25 dB, but not the best. Apart from these, I use the classic [Apple wired EarPods](https://geni.us/rsh-earpods) with lightning connector. They sound awesome for the price and even with couple of accidental washes, they still work fine. The only downside is how messy they tangle while in pocket or in bag. I also use a pair of Anker Soundcore neckband headphones while running & cycling. They sound terrible and I'm looking for an alternative.

**üì∏ Camera**: I also own a [Canon 700D/Rebel T5i](https://geni.us/rsh-700d) crop sensor DSLR camera since 2015. I pair it with a [Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM] or a [Canon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM Lens](https://geni.us/rsh-canon-24mm). These are great prime lenses and I love the extra sharpness and the creatve limitness due to the lack of zoom.  It also came with an [EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II](https://geni.us/rsh-canon-18-55) and [EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6](https://geni.us/rsh-canon-55-250) lenses, but I rarely use them as the lenses have aged and I prefer prime lenses over zoom.


## üèãFitness

**‚åöÔ∏è Fitness Tracker**: I use [Amazfit T-Rex Pro](https://geni.us/rsh-trex-pro) as my fitness tracker. It tracks my cycling, running and swimming workouts. The accuracy is pretty decent for the price and heart rate values are comparable to Apple Watch. It's rugged and battery life is awesome. The only downside for me is that it doesn't measure heart rate while swimming and also doesn't allow to pair any external sensors. All my activities are recorded via this and is synced to [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/67526871). 

**üö≤ Cycling**: I've been using a [Triban RC 100](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8810364/road-bikes/road-bike-triban-rc100-drop-bar?id=8810364&type=p) road bike for last 2 years now. It's a decent bike and I've clocked close to 10,000 kms so far. The one I have does not have drop bar shifters and came with 1x7 configuration. I've upgraded the bike with a [Shimano FC-R2000 Claris Crankset](https://bumsonthesaddle.com/products/shimano-fc-r2000-claris-double-crankset-8-speed) and a [Shimano Claris Front Derailleur](https://www.cyclop.in/products/shimano-claris-front-derailleur). I wear these [Endura Xtract Gel Shorts II](https://www.endurasport.com/xtract-gel-short-ii-black/12926408.html) for my long rides and I've wore them over 400kms in one-go. I also use these [Endura Aerogel Mitt](https://www.endurasport.com/fs260-pro-aerogel-mitt-navy/12929042.html) gloves for long endurance rides. I use these these [CateEye Omni 5](https://geni.us/rsh-cateye-omni5) rear LEDs that are battery powered and also these rechargable [cheap front lights](https://geni.us/rsh-bike-front-light) that can be charged using a power bank. For lubing the chain, I use [Squirt Lube](https://geni.us/rsh-squirt-lube), for punctures on the go, I use the [Park Tool's VP-1](https://geni.us/rsh-park-tool-vp1) patch kit alongwith the [Giyo GM-71 Hand Pump](https://www.cyclop.in/products/giyo-gm-71-pump). All other accessories like spare tubes, multitool, bags, jerseys,helmet,rain covers etc are from Decathlon. I use [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/67526871) for recording my rides and if the rides are longer (>200kms), I usually split it into multiple records and combine them using [GOTOES](https://gotoes.org/strava/Combine_GPX_TCX_FIT_Files.php)


**üèÉ Running**: My primary running shoe is [Hoka Mach 5](https://geni.us/rsh-hoka-mach5). These are great shoes as they offer quite cushioning and are light. I also own a pair of [Hoka Rinon 3](https://geni.us/rsh-hoka-rincon3). I bought since I got it at a very good deal. These are not as premium as the Mach 5, but still very light and fast. I use [these](https://www.decathlon.com/collections/running-shorts/products/running-breathable-shorts-dry-333374) and [these](https://www.decathlon.com/collections/running-shorts/products/running-lightweight-shorts-dry-119678) pair of shorts by Decathlon for running. My training app of choice for running is [TrainAsOne](https://beta.trainasone.com/register?referrer_token=XKWCgV2Kr9FdCV5G98lQ), an AI based training app that adapts with your performance. 

**üçé Nutrition**: I don't take many supplements apart from whey protein and fish oil. I currently take [Dymatize's ISO100 Hydrolyzed Protein Powder](https://geni.us/rs-dymatize) to meet my protein intake(Please do not buy the Gourmet chocolate, it's too sweet!). For fish oil, I prefer [Swisse's High Strength Odourless Wild Fish Oil](https://geni.us/rsh-swisse-fish-oil), as my fish intake has been low since moving to the UAE. I'm not 100% convinced of its benefits, but you can read some studies on it [here](https://examine.com/supplements/fish-oil/).


**üí™ Strength & Recovery**: I mainly use [Strong](https://www.strong.app/?utm_source=rishikeshs.com) app for tracking my workouts. At the end of the workout, I usually copy the exercises and the reps to my Strava workout as a backup. At times, I also use [StrenghtLevel](https://strengthlevel.com/?utm_source=rishikeshs.com) for checking my strength level and see how I compare with others. My go to resource for workouts and stretching is [MuscleWiki](https://musclewiki.com/?utm_source=rishikeshs.com). I also use the [Recover](https://recoverathletics.com/?utm_source=rishikeshs.com) app for doing stretching especially after my cardio workouts or when I'm nusring an injury. Other than this, I use this [deep tissue massage gun](https://geni.us/rsh-beatxp-massager) after my runs and also foam roll ocassionally for recovery. For my calves, knees and shin, I use this [cold gel pack](https://geni.us/rsh-inyx-cold-gel) for easy recovery.


**üßò Meditation**: My goto app for meditation is [Waking Up](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/shareOpenAccess/SC0DD5FAC) and I try to meditate listening to the daily meditations everyday. At times when I don't need a guided meditation, I use the [Oak](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oak-meditation-breathing/id1210209691) for creating a custom meditation with background noise.

**ü•ó Diet**: I try to be on calorie deficit on most of the days and use [HealthifyMe](https://www.healthifyme.com/in/?utm_source=rishikeshs.com) for tracking. I prefer it over MyFitnessPal since lot of the dishes I eat in Kerala cuisine is not available on MyFitnessPal. I occasionally do fasting and I prefer [Zero](https://zerolongevity.com/?utm_source=rishikeshs.com) to track these. I use [Libra](https://libra-app.eu/?utm_source=rishikeshs.com) for tracking my weight manually using a scale. I also use [MeThreeSixty](https://www.methreesixty.com/?utm_source=rishikeshs.com) app for determining my body fat composition. Lately the app has been performing quite buggy, so not really happy about that.

**üé≤ Misc**: For treking I use the Decathlon's [Forclaz Trek 100](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8319097/men-s-shoes/men-waterproof-trekking-boots-100-grey?id=8319097&type=p) shoes. 



## ‚ö∞Ô∏èGraveyard

- [GoPro Hero 5](https://geni.us/rsh-trex-pro): I do not use it anymore. It's one of the worst purchase decisions of my life.

- [Shiatsu Massager](https://geni.us/rsh-shiatsu-massager): Too bulky to carry around and store.
