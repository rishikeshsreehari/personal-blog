### 💭 What’s on My Mind?

The month of Ramadan has begun, and the weather is getting warmer. I wanted to squeeze in some cycling and running as much as possible before summer hits hard. A bit of traveling is coming up next month. First, Sri Lanka in the first week of April, followed by a month in India, and then Armenia in the second week of May. A bit of planning to do, but excited!

### 🏋 My Fitness

I've gone with a personal trainer since I felt that I'm not pushing myself enough! I go to the gym four days a week. I try to walk 5 km on gym days and bike a bit on Wednesdays and weekends! I'm following a sort of Push-Pull-Legs split since that is what my trainer is confident with. So it's chest & triceps on monday, back & biceps on tuesday, legs on thursday and finsihging week with some weak muscles shoulders, chest, biceps & core on Fridya. Feeling stronger, but not much fat loss has happened to be honest!
