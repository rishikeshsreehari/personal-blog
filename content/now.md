### 🏋 My Fitness

Currently in travel mode with very little activity. Lots of junk food, no time spent in the gym, with occasional runs. Can't wait to bring back my bike, start cycling, hit the gym regularly, and get in shape!

<!--  

I'm currently focused on transforming my body and reducing my body fat to below 25%. This involves a lot of protein and long walks to ensure I'm in a calorie deficit while building muscle and losing fat.

I'm now doing strength training 3x a week, following [Greg Nuckol's beginner program](https://www.boostcamp.app/coaches/greg-nuckols/greg-nuckols-beginner-program) on Boostcamp. On gym days, I try to walk 5km and on other days I try to do light jogs. [My ankle](/journal/ankle-sprain/) is feeling better, and the doctor has given the green light for short runs and squats with light weights. I still feel a bit uneasy with deep squats at the lower position. Need a bit more work on the stability part, few more rehab sessions to go. Can't wait to run freely!

##### For my latest fitness updates, read my [fitness log](/fitness-log). It's interesting, I promise.
