### 🏋 My Workout Regime

I'm currently focusing on transforming my body and bringing my body fat down to below 25%. That means a lot of protein and long walks to ensure that I'm in a calorie deficit while gaining muscle and losing fat. These days, I work out four days a week at the gym following Trainer Winny's [beginner plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9ENCvFf9yQ). It's mainly a mix of compound exercises like bench press, overhead press, barbell row, squat, and deadlift. I'm nursing an [ankle sprain](/journal/ankle-sprain/), so squats and running are out of the equation, at least for a couple of weeks. Summer is officially over, and the weather is getting nicer day by day. I'm itching to run, but I guess I'll have to wait and focus on rehab.

##### For my latest fitness updates, read my [fitness log](/fitness-log). It's interesting, I promise.
