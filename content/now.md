### 💭 What’s on My Mind?

Winter is almost over and I can feel it. I can see Vimto bottles popping up in stores, with Ramadan around the corner. Grateful for the winter, but yet again not prepared mentally to face the summer heat! I want to cycle as much as I can before summer hits hard!

### 🏋 My Fitness

I'm currently focused on transforming my body and reducing my body fat to below 25%. This involves a lot of protein and long walks to ensure I'm in a calorie deficit while building muscle and losing fat.

I've gone with a personal trainer since I felt that I'm not pushing myself enough! I go to the gym four days a week. I try to walk 5 km on gym days and bike a bit on Wednesdays and weekends! I'm following a sort of Push-Pull-Legs split since that is what my trainer is confident with. So it's Push on Monday, Pull on Tuesday, and Legs on Thursday. On Fridays, I focus on core and some weak muscles like arms and shoulders!
