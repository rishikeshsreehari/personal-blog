### 💭 What’s on My Mind?

No more travel at least for next few months. All I want to do is have a routine, gain some momentum and just focus on things I want to do. For now it's about health, learning and job hunt. Nothing else.

### 🔨 What am I Doing?

-  [Currently looking for opportunities](/hire), I’m dedicating most of my time to job applications and exploring freelance opportunities.

- Unnecessarily tweaking and over-engineering this blog! You can see the progress [here](/log).

### 🏋 My Fitness

Gained a bit of fat after the India trip. So mostly it's 4 x strength training trying to hit 10,000 steps a day. Trying to run twice a week with a bike ride on weekends. But summer is here and its hot!
