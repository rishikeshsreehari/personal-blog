### üí≠ What‚Äôs on My Mind?

The weather is very good here in Abu Dhabi now‚Äîit's the best time for some sightseeing. I'm excited about visiting a few art galleries and museums. One big goal I have now is to get my driving license here in Abu Dhabi. It's a challenge, but exciting times lie ahead!

Also working as a freelancer in UAE is bit tricky when it comes to finding information online. Figuring out the whole freelance license thing!

### üèã My Fitness


I'm currently focused on transforming my body and reducing my body fat to below 25%. This involves a lot of protein and long walks to ensure I'm in a calorie deficit while building muscle and losing fat.

I'm now doing strength training 3x a week, following [Greg Nuckol's beginner program](https://www.boostcamp.app/coaches/greg-nuckols/greg-nuckols-beginner-program) on Boostcamp. On gym days I try to go for a walk in the evenings. Other days, I try to alternate between cycling and light jogging.
