Since late 2023, I've been tracking every movie, TV shows, and documentary I've watched. Mostly, I watch content in Malayalam (my mother tongue) and English, but with my wife being a Tamilian and a fan of Hindi movies, I've started to watch content in these languages as well. The goal is to rate and reflect on each one, capturing my initial impressions and seeing how my opinions evolve over time. It's fascinating to see how tastes changeâ€”some films I once disliked have become favorites, and vice versa. All ratings and opinions are my own and if you have a conflicting opinion, I would love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to [reach out](/contact). I will try to add a short review of what I felt after watching each item. If a review is missing, I'll link to the corresponding Letterboxd page for movies or Serializd for tv shows.

For a list of what I'm planning to watch in the future, head over to the [watchlist](/watchlist) page!
