Every Tuesday and Thursday, [09:00 PM GST (UTC+4)](https://shareti.me/2024-06-17/21:45/+4:00), my calendar is open for 45 minutes for an open discussion.

Unoffice hours are informal conversations without an agenda, topic, or preparation. Some interesting topics we can discuss are:
- An interesting movie you saw recently and why it's great.
- A project you are working on and need some feedback.
- If you wish to [hire me](/hire) for some work or want to collaborate with me on a project.
- You were intrigued by some [ideas](/ideas) I listed and wanted to chat more.
- Or anything you want to discuss.

As an experiment, [Matt Webb](https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/24/unoffice_hours) came up with the idea of [Unoffice hours](https://unofficehours.com/) in 2020 as a twist to office hours and opened up his calendar to discuss random things.
