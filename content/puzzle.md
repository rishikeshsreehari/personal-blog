I love solving puzzles. In fact, one of my favorite bedtime routines is to solve [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) every day before I go to sleep. So, I had this idea the other day - why not run a puzzle that never ends? A perpetual puzzle that continues as long as I'm alive or able to update this website.

**How it works:**
- A puzzle stays active until solved.
- New puzzle appears once the current one is cracked.
- First solver gets a mention and backlink (both optional; personal sites or socials only).
- Optional 15-min chat with me for the winner.

**To participate:**
- Send answers to puzzle[at]rishikeshs.com.
- Include your name and backlink if desired.
- Keep it simple - just the answer in the email body.

No specific rules, just figure out the word/thing/place/item. Clues provided if 10+ people request.

*Note: Puzzles marked "Source: Self" are original. "Source: External" puzzles will have attribution once solved.*
