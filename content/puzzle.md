#####  {{< updated_on >}}


I love solving puzzles. In fact, one of my favorite bedtime routines is to solve [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) every day before I go to sleep. So, I had this idea the other day - why not run a puzzle that never ends? A perpetual puzzle that continues as long as I'm alive or able to update this website.

**How it works:**
- Only one puzzle is active at a time - it stays open until solved.  
- New puzzle appears once the current one is cracked.
- First solver gets a mention and backlink (both optional; personal sites or socials only).

**To participate:**
- Send answers to puzzle[at]rishikeshs.com.
- Include your name and backlink(optional). 
- Keep it simple - just the answer in the email body.

No specific rules, just figure out the word/thing/place/item. If 5 or more people request a clue for the current puzzle, I’ll provide one.


*Note: Puzzles marked "Source: Self" are original. "Source: External" puzzles will have attribution once solved.*

```
I left a trail for the curious.
Just follow the shortcut to ‘find’ it.
Sometimes, the shortest path leads straight to the truth.

P.S: I hate long URLs.
