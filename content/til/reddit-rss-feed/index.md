Today I learned that you can get an RSS feed for any subreddit or even an individual Reddit post by appending `.rss` to the URL.  

For example, if you want to subscribe to the RSS feed for the [r/SideProjects](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/) subreddit, simply add `.rss` to the end of the URL:  

`https://www.reddit.com/r/sideprojects.rss`

This method works with and without the final slash. You can use the resulting feed URL in your preferred RSS reader to keep up with subreddit activity without opening Reddit.  

Bonus: You can also track Reddit links to a specific domain by visiting:  


` https://www.reddit.com/domain/yourwebsite.com.rss `


This can be handy for monitoring when a website is linked on Reddit.  

This trick is a simple yet effective way to stay updated without the distractions of browsing Reddit!
