Today I learned that many bike pumps with a reversible head can be used for both Schrader and Presta valves by flipping the internal components. 

Inside the pump head, there are small parts that can be reversed to fit either valve type. Schrader valves are typically found on car tires and some bikes, while Presta valves are more common on road and performance bikes. This clever design means you donâ€™t need separate pumps for different valve types. But ensure that you rememeber this configuration.
