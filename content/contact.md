The best and quickest way to connect with me is by filling out the form below. I usually reply within 3-4 days unless I'm traveling or out of network. Iâ€™m passively active on some social networks, and you can reach out to me by following the icons below. To support my work, visit the [support](/support) page.


I love interacting with new people and talking about interesting stuff, and often meet people [virtually](/unoffice-hours) or in-person if they are in the same city. If you wish to have an open conversation with me virtually or in-person, check out my [meet page](/meet).
