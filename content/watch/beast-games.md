I must admit, I sort of like Jimmy (MrBeast) for his grind and determination! I have watched most of his videos over the last couple of years, but lately, I’ve been bored due to the repetitive content. However, when he announced a show with Amazon, I was excited and expected a lot, considering the humongous budget!

But I must say, I’m disappointed! This just felt like yet another MrBeast video with some grandiosity for the sake of it. The editing felt poor, with unnecessary cuts here and there to create artificial drama. Jimmy’s exaggerated delivery, along with his co-stars, was so annoying. Regardless of the effort they put in, it lacked creativity. The usual boring MrBeast challenges—nothing extraordinary. In fact, while reviewing it, I realized just how creative the folks behind Squid Game were, but with MrBeast, all the games felt dull or like something I had already watched.

There is no shortage of reality shows, so what was the point of this if the only unique proposition was the prize money and the budget? This might be too harsh to say, but at times, the editing made it feel like I was watching some Survivor reality show or some MTV garbage!

Also the unnecessary emotional scenes felt uite fake and didn't fit into place at all. Also, I noticed this. Some contestants who were portrayed as poor

Dear MrBeast, I expected a lot from you, and you failed. Please deliver something unique and creative next time!

Overall, I wouldn’t recommend watching this. I watched it just to see what the hype was all about. At no point was I excited or on the edge of my seat, unlike with some of MrBeast’s past videos. This should have been a YouTube series instead of premiering on Amazon Prime!
