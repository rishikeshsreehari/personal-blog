I had no idea about this documentary, but it came up just in time before the coveted India vs. Pakistan match in the Champions Trophy. This looked like a publicity stunt by Netflix to capitalize on the high-profile match and get some eyeballs on its platform. I mean, I'm not sure why they made this documentary. Nothing was particularly good or bad. It felt like the overall series existed for no reason. Weirdly, I cannot find much information about the series online either. Even the name of the director was hard to find. I found him on IMDb but had never heard of him! Coming to the documentary, it was more like a few past India/Pakistan players sharing their experiences. This shouldn't have existed. If anything, it would have been a better fit as a YouTube series!
