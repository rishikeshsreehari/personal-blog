**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

Felt like a cooked up script to reach the climax. There were no moments of visual tension or emotional connection. Vijay Sethupathi's performance was a letdown. Anurag Kashyap tried, but his body language and acting felt unnatural at moments. I think there were issues with dubbing as well. Overall, standout performances were by the actress who played the Jyothi character and also the {{< spoiler >}}actor who played Nallasivam. How the police figured out all this story and how maharaja has 15 lakh in bank account is a mystery to me. Apart from taking the daughter to the sports meet, I still don't know the significance of the coach's character. {{< /spoiler >}} Overall, the direction and script were a letdown. There were no moments of brilliant cinematography and the movie had zero impact on me.
