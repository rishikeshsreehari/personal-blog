**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

This is my first time watching a Vetrimaaran movie, other than watching [Oor Iravu (Paava Kadhaigal)](https://letterboxd.com/film/paava-kadhaigal/). I'm not sure if it's because I watched the OTT version, but I felt some edits were very weird. There were some abrupt scene changes, probably due to reducing the total running time. However, I believe I watched the director's cut on ZEE5.

Loved the performances by Suri and Chetan. Can't really judge Vijay Sethupathi's acting since his screen time was limited. I didn't particularly like his acting {{< spoiler >}} in the flashback scene at the police station{{< /spoiler >}}. Hated Gautam Vasudev Menon's acting—not sure why he was cast for this role. I loved the script. The cinematography was promising in some shots, especially the opening scene. But at times, it failed to create those "wow" moments. 

My biggest issue with the movie is the locations. Maybe it's just me, but I felt quite disconnected with the premise that this is happening in a hilly area. At the start,{{< spoiler >}}
 when Suri goes to a checkpost inside the forest, it really gave me a hilly vibe{{< /spoiler >}}. But other than that, I think some locations and the topography didn't connect with me. It’s probably because of a mental image I have of a hilly village. Another thing I disliked was the poor acting by supporting characters—it could have been much better.

Overall, a good watch with a great script that created a lot of emotions, which I believe matters the most.

Excited for [Viduthalai 2 !](https://letterboxd.com/film/viduthalai-part-ii/)
