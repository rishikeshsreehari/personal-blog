**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

Wanted to watch something brainless while having lunch. Found this randomly on Prime and decided to give it a go. Nothing much to say—poor script, mediocre direction, with some decent performances by Siddique and Suraj. I don't even know why they take movies like these. If this were a short film, it would have made some sense.
