**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**


I watched Paatal Lok a few months back and loved it. My wife suggested we watch the latest season, and we ended up binge-watching it in one go! I loved this season even more than the first, for which I had written a small review.

What can I say? Jaideep Ahlawat's performance is on another level! Having lived in Delhi for some time, I can’t think of anyone who could portray this character better than him. The chemistry between Ansari and the other characters was spot on. The shots in Nagaland and the actors who portrayed Naga characters were amazing. I read comments from various Naga people about how well the local language and culture were handled, which makes it even more impressive.

With minor superhuman elements involving Jaideep here and there, the script overall was excellent. However,{{< spoiler >}}  the hospital scene, where he tries to block a group of people, wasn’t entirely convincing{{< /spoiler >}} . I also have a few  doubts that remain unresolved:

{{< spoiler >}} 

- What was the whole scene with Reddy about? Some closure would have been great!
- Why did Max Rizu hang himself? Was it because he felt guilty about his son?
- Who killed the businessman who was trying to buy the hotels?
- What about the hawala note scene? I found it quite confusing. I read on Reddit that hawala dealers use a torn note as some sort of code.

{{< /spoiler >}} 


Overall, it’s a fantastic watch! I enjoyed it even more than the first season. I’m also thrilled that a major TV show like this is portraying a less-represented part of India, such as the North-East.
