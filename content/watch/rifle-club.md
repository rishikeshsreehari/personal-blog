**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

I had high expectations from the trio—Aashiq Abu, Dileesh Pothan, and Shyam Pushkaran—but the movie was a disappointment. While the performances were wonderful, the storyline was quite poor. Barring a few punchy dialogues and double-meaning jokes, the movie didn’t serve much purpose.

The performances by all the actors were commendable, but the screen time given to each character was too little to develop any complex arcs. The artwork and overall setting were amazing, but the loose storyline ruined the experience. The movie overall felt like [Varathan](https://letterboxd.com/film/varathan/), where only the last 15 minutes seemed to matter. Until the first half, I was fully invested, but the second half and the climax were a complete letdown. I kept waiting for something extraordinary to happen, but nothing clicked.

I’m not against shorter films, but this one felt incomplete.

Also, I had a doubt:{{< spoiler >}} the final tally shows a total of 39 bullets fired—3 each for 13 people. But that doesn’t feel accurate. Does this include the final shots fired at Anurag? And what about the guns in the locker?{{< /spoiler >}} Was there any explanation for that? I’m not sure why people on Reddit compare this movie to Tarantino’s works. {{< spoiler >}}It would’ve been epic if someone had gone to the locker and used a flamethrower, like in [Once Upon a Time in Hollywood](https://letterboxd.com/film/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/)! At least that would’ve added some excitement.{{< /spoiler >}}

Overall, it’s not worth the hype. Watch it for some fun, but don’t expect anything extraordinary.
