**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

I loved the performances by everyone. I appreciate that they didn’t rush the episodes just to finish the season. The direction was excellent, and the performances were top-notch as well.  {{< spoiler >}}However, I felt that Daemon was a bit underutilized this season.{{< /spoiler >}} As always, I loved Ramin Djawadi’s music. {{< spoiler >}}I also felt that the last scene between Rhaenyra and Alicent should have been more powerful. I didn’t like that part, even though it was pivotal—it could have been made more emotional. Other than that, I think the finale wasn’t grand enough; they could have ended it better, especially considering that fans will have to wait a year or more for the next season. But the build-up is there, so I’m hopeful!{{< /spoiler >}}
