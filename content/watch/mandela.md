This is a political satire movie showcasing the deep-rooted caste issues in India.

I watched this on a lazy Sunday, hungover. It’s a feel-good movie with nothing much to say! Performances were spot on from everyone(Yogi Babu was spot on!), including all supporting and junior artists. I really felt like I was in that village, watching all the events unfold. I was on my toes until the ending happened. But after the climax, it felt like a movie with an Aesop’s fables kind of message.

Overall, a decent watch, highlighting important social issues with some good highs!
