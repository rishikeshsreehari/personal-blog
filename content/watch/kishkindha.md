**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**  

After last week's [disaster](/adios-amigo/), I was hesitant to invest time in watching another of Asif's movies. I didn’t watch the trailer, so there were zero expectations. It turned out to be a decent watch, with amazing performances, a superb background score, and great cinematography. The only letdown was the script at times. There were a few loopholes or things that didn’t make sense. But overall, it was a great concept and a different kind of thriller that you don’t often see in Malayalam cinema.

Also, I have a couple of questions that baffle me:
{{< spoiler >}}

Why didn’t the wife feel suspicious about the blood stains on his ex-wife's dress?
How did Vijaya Raghavan get the medical records of someone else?
At times, the movie felt like an amalgamation of 50 First Dates and Shutter Island. I wish they had worked a bit more on the script, and it could have been a stunner!

{{< /spoiler >}}

Overall, it’s a decent watch with solid performances and filmmaking, with no lag! Loved Vijaya Raghavan’s performance, especially. Asif really surprised me with his acting!
