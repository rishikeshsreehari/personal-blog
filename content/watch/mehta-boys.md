**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

My wife started watching this movie, and I wasn’t supposed to watch it, but I found it interesting in the first 10–15 minutes. Decided to go for it and ended up with a decent watch. To be honest, I didn’t know much about Boman Irani, but there were a few moments that reminded me of some scenes with the Principal from ['3 Idiots'](https://letterboxd.com/film/3-idiots/) film, and I was spot on—he was the same guy!

Coming to the movie, there were a lot of emotional moments combined with amazing acting. Boman Irani just rocked the show throughout the film!

The art direction throughout was a standout for me. {{< spoiler >}}The balcony scene where they were drinking and the restaurant scene were so well done {{< /spoiler >}}. Where the film lacked was in a solid script. The premise and context were amazing, but the writers failed to produce something classy to complement the acting and direction. The writing felt so loose and so typical in multiple places,  especially the scene {{< spoiler >}}in the office where Avinash argues with his senior manager{{< /spoiler >}}.

The ending was realistic but a bit meh for me! I know this is cliché, but I wished the ending was like this: {{< spoiler >}}Avinash goes to drop his father at the airport, and just as he’s about to go inside, I wanted him to tell his father not to move to Florida! Then both of them move back to their home and settle there. Probably, this is my nostalgia speaking—feeling homesick being away from home{{< /spoiler >}}.

There were some solid moments throughout the movie that created a lot of visual tension and emotions. I just wish the script had been a bit more solid—this could have been a great movie. Still, a decent watch you won’t regret!
