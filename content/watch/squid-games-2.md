**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

I loved the show, other than the fact that {{< spoiler >}} they could have just made this into one single season instead of extending it to another season and ending it on a cliffhanger! {{< /spoiler >}}

Very good performances, direction, cinematography—everything was spot on, at least for me. Loved the surprises and, overall, the game part. {{< spoiler >}} Loved the mini-game round as well! {{< /spoiler >}} Looks like the Korean writers have no issues, while Mr. Beast is struggling to find new ideas for games!

I can't wait for the 3rd season, especially {{< spoiler >}} what the security guard girl is going to do. {{< /spoiler >}}
