 Well, Jeethu Joseph as a director is not my favorite, but I had some expectations from him. However, this totally blew me off. I'm not sure why he agreed to direct such a poor script. It's a comedy movie, I agree, but there should be some thread at least, right? Poorly written with cooked-up stories just for the sake of stretching the movie. It reminds me of old Dileep movies! Nothing special when it comes to acting. Basil did a decent job, but it's high time he comes out of these kinds of roles before the audience gets bored of his repetitive performances. Siddique did a decent job. Manoj K Jayan's acting didn't feel realistic. Except for some typical one-liners by Baiju, the jokes didn't click at all.

Overall, a poor movie I don't recommend at all. The weird thing is that the pre-release promotions by the crew were better than the whole movie itself.


#### Update 17-01-2024:
Last weekend, I was forced to watch it again with couple of friends. I was drunk, so laughed a bit more. But yeah still, it's a film not worth watching!
