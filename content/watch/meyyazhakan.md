**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

A feel-good, heartwarming movie with great performances and an average script. I think such movies should not be dissected for technicality. It's a simple movie, a tale of two men with not much of a storyline. Don’t think too much—it makes you feel warm and nostalgic at times.

Coming to the performances, Karthi and Arvind Swamy killed it with their rapport. I even teased my wife, saying that maybe Vijay Sethupathi should learn acting from Arvind Swamy
, considering my disappointment watching [Maharaja](/watch/maharaja). The cinematography was decent, with some beautiful shots. There’s nothing much to say about the direction; there were moments where I felt it was too cringe or unnecessary, {{< spoiler >}} especially the bride scene on the stage, the bull-fight part and also the cobra thing. I also felt that the intro scene were they were moving was too long and boring  {{< /spoiler >}} . The script lacked depth, but they probably meant for this movie to be light.

A great one-time watch!



#### Update 29-10-2024:
I read on Reddit that almost 20 minutes were cut from the original theatrical release to address the movie's lagginess. I'm not sure why!
