**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

A bold attempt by Mammootty. His acting was top-notch, along with some beautiful frames, especially of Jyotika. However, Jyotika's acting and the dubbing/lip-sync were a letdown. The story and idea were great, but the script lacked depth. There were some moments of visual tension, but overall, the impact was minimal. At times, it felt like the movie relied too heavily on {{< spoiler >}} the LGBTQ content. The other co-actors, except for Mammootty’s advocate, were just average. I’m not sure what value the young kid's character added to the story. I’m also confused about how everyone knew about the divorce and its details—who leaked it? {{< /spoiler >}}While the thread was great, the script lacked depth, and the acting was poor, except for Mammootty.
