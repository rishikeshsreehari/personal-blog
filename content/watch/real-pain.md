What a beautiful movie! I don't have much to say, but this is such a wholesome movie. There were a lot of moments with visual tension, which was conveyed so well by the director. Especially the initial briefing scene before the trip, as well as the dinner scene. I personally did a Holocaust tour in Germany back in 2019, and I could relate a lot to certain scenes. The ending is left open, which I loved, but my wife disagrees. Overall, a great movie with awesome performances. There is nothing much to say!
