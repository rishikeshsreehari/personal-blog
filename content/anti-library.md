This is my [antilibrary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilibrary), a collection of books that I intend to read in the future. While the original idea of an antilibrary refers to a collection of books that are owned but not yet read, for me, this is more of a 'to-read' list that I maintain whenever I come across an interesting book. Comments are enabled on this page, and if you have any good suggestions, I would love to add them to my list.
