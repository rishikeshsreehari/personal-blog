This page represents a timeline of my life in weeks, inspired by ['Life in Weeks'](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) by Tim Urban. Each box represents a week of my life, starting from the week I was born. Each row consists of 26 weeks, so approximately two rows represent one year of my life. Since a standard (non-leap) year consists of 52 weeks and 1 day, while a leap year consists of 52 weeks and 2 days, there may be a slight error in the week calculation, which is insignificant. The percentage indicator shows what percentage of my life I've already lived, based on a global life expectancy of [{{< lifespan_value_fetch >}} years](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy). In the timeline below, green boxes indicate the weeks I've already lived, empty ones indicate weeks yet to live, and blue ones indicate weeks with important milestones (hover to view or long press on mobile on blueboxes).
