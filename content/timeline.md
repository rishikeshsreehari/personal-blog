This page represents a timeline of my life in weeks, inspired by 'Life in Weeks' by Tim Urban. Each box represents a week of my life, starting from the week I was born. Each row consists of 26 weeks, so approximately two rows represent one year of my life. Since a standard (non-leap) year consists of 52 weeks and 1 day, while a leap year consists of 52 weeks and 2 days, there may be a slight error in the week calculation, which is insignificant. The percentage indicator shows what percentage of my life I've already lived, based on a global life expectancy of {{< lifespan_value_fetch >}} years. In the timeline below, green boxes indicate the weeks I've already lived, empty ones indicate weeks yet to live, and blue ones indicate weeks with important milestones (hover to view).
