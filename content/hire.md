Welcome to my hire page! Here’s where you can find out more about how I can contribute to your projects. Whether you're in academia, industry, or working on something entirely new, here’s how I can help:

### Energy/Climate Space

I hold a Master’s Degree in Renewable Energy and Distributed Generation and have experience in energy system modeling, focusing on open energy models and low-carbon strategies. My expertise includes using frameworks like PyPSA to explore net-zero pathways and renewable energy integration. I have worked on projects at both national and sub-national levels, developing optimization models, forecasting energy demand, and analyzing electricity consumption trends.

Alongside system modeling, I’ve also worked in the mini-grid sector, managing smart metering systems and overseeing the remote monitoring of mini-grid sites. This experience has given me valuable insights into distributed energy systems and the intricacies of ensuring reliable, clean energy access.

I’m currently available for remote positions or jobs in Dubai and open to relocating for opportunities in Europe or North America. I’m particularly interested in roles within academia or industry that involve energy system optimization, renewable energy integration, or climate-related research. I’m also open to pursuing a funded PhD or Research Assistant position in these areas.

If you’re looking for expertise in energy system modeling or renewable energy solutions, I’d love to collaborate.

### Personal Blogs
I have a deep love for personal blogs and the eclectic, interesting content shared by people in wild west corners of the internet. If you’re looking to create your own blog or need help setting one up, I’d be happy to assist. Whether it’s Hugo, Pelican, WordPress, or a custom-built blog using more basic technologies, I can help you bring your ideas to life.

What really excites me isn’t just the tech behind blogs, but the spirit of personal expression they represent. If that resonates with you, let’s explore some ideas together

### Freelance Web Development
I’m also open to freelance work as a web developer, specializing primarily in Python-based solutions. Whether you need help building a custom web app, API development, or backend functionality, I can bring your vision to life with a clear focus on performance and user experience.

If you have a web development project in mind, I’m ready to dive in.

Beyond these specific areas, I’m always curious to hear about exciting new ideas and challenges. I’m based in the Middle East and have a particular interest in projects in this region, though I’m open to working with teams from anywhere in the world. If you’re working on something innovative, I’d love to be a part of it.
