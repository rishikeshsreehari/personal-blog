{{< dropcap >}} At the end of 2020, I decided to quit my job and backpack for the next 6 months on a journey of self-discovery. Fast-forward to April 2021, I had to stop traveling and go back home due to the [second wave of the pandemic in India](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56771766). The journey changed me a lot, and I decided to make small changes in my daily routine for a fulfilled life with happiness and financial freedom. Among the daily habits I decided to follow, reading was one of them. {{< /dropcap >}}

I have always loved reading, but somewhere in the past few years, I lost the habit. I decided to take up the 52 books in 52 weeks challenge in 2021 and was constantly searching for books to read. That's when I stumbled upon the book, ['Show Your Work!'](https://geni.us/rsh-ShowYourWork) by [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/), shared by the productivity YouTuber [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg), whom I have been [following](https://aliabdaal.com/) for a while.

I read the book and was surprised by how much I connected with its ideas. In the [book](https://geni.us/rsh-ShowYourWork), Austin describes your work as a never-ending process and explains how you can build an audience around it with goal-accountability. The idea struck me so well that I decided to document my personal transformation journey through this blog. Below are the 5 reasons that eventually led me to start this blog.

## 1. Goal Accountability

Putting your ideas or projects into the public makes you more accountable than having a mental note. As the famous scientist Richard Feynman said, "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool." Having my projects or goals documented in a blog makes me more accountable than if they were just in my head. I can no longer procrastinate or forget about my goals because I’m now accountable to my readers.

## 2. Documenting Life

I no longer remember the books I have read or the projects I have worked on in the past. I do not have any notes or photos of those. Blogging helps me document my journey, and later I can reflect on myself to see where I can improve. In fact, the [early days of blogging](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/history-of-blogging) were indeed about documenting your life and writing about everyday happenings.

## 3. Writing as a Skill

I have always struggled with writing. I remember my postgraduate days when I struggled with writing 3,000-word assignments. Blogging can improve your writing skills and change your perspective. It also improves your ability to convey thoughts or ideas into words. Writing is one skill I aim to improve by the end of this year.

## 4. Building a Community

One of my dreams is to build a community of people with whom I share the same values and perceptions of life. The ideal community would work on solutions for the sustainability of this planet. Through this blog, I can connect with like-minded people who share similar interests (My current interests are mentioned on [this page](https://rishikeshs.com/about/)). The ['10+1 Things'](https://rishikesh.substack.com/) newsletter, which I publish on Substack, is my first step toward building that community.

## 5. One Step towards Financial Freedom

Like many people, achieving financial freedom is one of my life goals. This blog is one of the first steps toward it. I plan to document some projects I have been working on for a while on this blog. As my audience grows, blogging will help me increase the reach of those projects. I also use affiliate networks, especially [Amazon](https://geni.us/rsh-amazon), on this blog for passive income.

### Goals for Blogging in 2021

> I’m targeting a traffic of **5,000 visitors per month** for this blog by the end of 2021. I also aim to grow my ['10+1 Things'](https://rishikesh.substack.com/) newsletter by **1,000 subscribers** and my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rishikeshshari)/[Instagram](https://instagram.com/rishikesh.me) followers by **1,000 followers**.
