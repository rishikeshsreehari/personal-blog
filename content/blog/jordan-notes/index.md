- We couldn't find any Coke in Jordan probably due to boycott. Matrix cola was common and tbh it tasted good.
- Petra is expensive
- Taxi rides in petra are expensier than in Amman
- Publich transport exists a lot, you just have to find it. Don't worry you would find a warranty
- Even though it's a muslim country, dirnking alcohol is not really frowned upon. Alcohol shops are open till 2AM, accept cards.
- Heard it from the shopkeeper and a local, but the locally brewed Amstel is better than what they have in Belgium
- Everybody smokes a lot.
- Cars are chinese mostly, hybrid, fuel pirces were expensive
- Country is expensive, 1.25 USD is 1 JOD
- It snows in Amman
- Royal family appoints prime minister??
- lot of spices
- food grows in jordan valley
- good anchor point for price comparison is price of dead sea mud mask, which is 1 JOD
- For dead sea, no need to book expensive hotels, buy day pass and visit
- Jordan Kuwait Bank has no fees
- Careem works better in Amman
- City felt safe and comparatively clean
- We didn;t see much indian expats, but some philipino people in workforce especially in hospitality
- Personally feel like Amman can become a great digital nomad capital
- Alcohol is very good
- Petra is quite expensive and food is just average
- People throwing teabags to roof for luck
