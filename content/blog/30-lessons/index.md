Following the trend on the internet, I published [27 lessons](/27-lessons) when I turned 27 and [28 lessons](/28-lessons/) when I turned 28. I missed out last year, but as I recently turned 30, I decided to share a few lessons this time. These are insights I jotted down in Obsidian throughout the year, which I’ve polished and edited into this post to mark my birthday.

1. It doesn't matter who you were; all that matters is who you are now. As [Sivers says](https://sive.rs/expire), _"Someone who played football in high school can’t call himself an athlete forever. Someone who did something successful long ago can’t keep calling himself a success."_
2. Before renting or buying a place in a new area, visit it at different times on different days. A quiet neighborhood on Sunday can be noisy during the week due to nearby construction.
3. Pack your running shoes, swimming shorts, and goggles everywhere you go.
4. Build relationships and don’t burn bridges throughout your career. References and recommendations matter, especially if you’re applying for research positions or switching careers.
5. If you are starting strength training, focus on the main compound lifts: deadlift, squats, bench press, barbell rows, and overhead press. Learn and master them.
6. Invest in good running shoes. They can be pricey, but they’re worth it for injury prevention and maintaining proper form.
7. Don’t try to create a fitness routine on your own. Many experts have already done the work, so don’t reinvent the wheel. Pick a [beginner routine from r/fitness](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/), stick with it, and trust the process.
8. Always carry a small padlock when you travel. You never know when your suitcase lock might malfunction.
9. If your air conditioner, especially a window AC, smells fishy, chances are there’s mold inside.
10. Jot down the dates of all your international travels. This comes in handy when applying for visas, which often require details of your past travel history.
11. If your kitchen or room smells of fish, boil orange peel with cinnamon and cloves. Let it simmer for a while to get rid of the bad odor and leave a pleasant fragrance.
12. When visiting a new city, start with a small guided walking tour to get familiar with the place. Most big cities offer free walking tours.
13. To know more about your close friends or life partners, go on a multi-day trek with no cellphones or distractions.
14. Your bachelor’s or master’s thesis or projects matter a lot. Pick an interesting one with depth so it creates scope for engaging conversations during interviews.
15. Before shaking your protein shaker or bottle, always double-check if the lid is closed and tightened properly. You don’t want it to splash everywhere!
16. Oral hygiene matters a lot. Start flossing and use [interdental brushes](https://geni.us/rs-interdental) if needed.
17. Unless it’s a pressing issue that affects you or others, don’t correct people. Most of the time, it can come across as offensive.
18. When learning to lift or mastering swimming, watch short videos before sessions, even if you think you know it. Over time, it will reinforce good techniques in your form.
19. You’re never going to watch all the movies you want to watch, read all the books you want to read, or tick off everything from your dream list.
20. If you can afford it, hire a personal trainer. If they’re good enough, they will push you to your limits and teach you proper form. If not, at least hire one for a few sessions to learn the main compound lifts.
21. Indoor air quality is often worse than outdoor air due to lack of circulation. If you live in a city and have kids, monitor indoor air quality and consider getting an air purifier.
22. Most gyms offer daily passes, which can be more economical if you go fewer than four days a week. For example, my gym charges 600 AED for a three-month plan, but a 50-day pass book costs me only 500 AED. Plus, I don’t have to pay for days I don’t want to go!
23. If your crypto is worth more than $500, move it to a [hardware wallet](https://geni.us/rs-ledger) and store it safely.
24. When buying socks, stick to two colors: one for your workouts (running, gym, etc.) and the other for everyday life.
25. Hire a nutritionist, even if you already know about calories, macros, and overall nutrition. Having someone to be accountable to can work wonders. Over time, it will help you build better habits and discipline with food.
26. There’s nothing wrong with following up or sending reminder emails.
27. Before booking tickets to a country that requires a visa, call a local travel agent. Some countries tend to reject tourist visas without giving a reason.
28. If you have crooked, gapped, or rotated teeth, or any other dental issues, get braces as soon as possible. They can fix a lot of problems like biting, smiling, and even jaw disorders. If you want to avoid braces and have the budget, consider [Invisalign](https://www.invisalign.in/).
29. Don’t be the person who doesn’t show up for meetings or appointments. If you can’t make it, at least have the courtesy to inform in advance.
30. When you add a new contact to your phone, append it with their birthday. For instance, save it as “John Doe 2811.”

That's it see you next year!
