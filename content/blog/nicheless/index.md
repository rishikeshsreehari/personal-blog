I will admit it—I often look at my blog's analytics now and then. I can see which posts are popular, and I find a sense of joy looking at it. But when I sit down to write, SEO, algorithms, click-baity titles, or pageviews are the last things on my mind. Usually, I just have an idea, like this one while I was high on coffee with racing thoughts. When an idea hits me, I jot it down in my Obsidian notes without worrying about spelling or grammar—just capturing the raw thought. I write for something much deeper, the freedom to be irreplaceable, to create the only version of my thoughts and experiences that exists in the world.

This blog is my digital playground, where I don’t need a specific direction or niche to justify what I share. I even touched on this in [_My Blog is My Greatest Art_](/blog-art/), where I think of the blog as an evolving art project, but it’s also a space where I get to be myself without boundaries, write without restrictions, and explore whatever piques my curiosity.

### Becoming Unique

I think one common career advice people receive is to become irreplaceable in organizations. But I think this never works in a career—even Steve Jobs was replaceable. In a world filled with specialized content, being nicheless is my way of embracing my own uniqueness. Out of the billions of people online, no one can capture my unique perspective, my strange intersections of thought, or the winding journey that led me here. Writing without a niche lets me shape a space that reflects all the different parts of me—without having to fit into anyone else’s categories. This is my version of the world, with all its quirks, imperfections, and randomness. It’s mine, and no one else can replicate it.

### Keeping the Spirit of the Old Web

I want this space to feel like the old internet—a time when people wrote blogs to connect with other people, not to please bots and algorithms. There’s a charm in creating content purely for the joy of sharing, a rare authenticity in knowing that every word here is for whoever stumbles upon it, whether that’s one person or one thousand. And that’s part of why I became nicheless: it’s my way of keeping the spirit of that web alive.

Look at people like [Derek Sivers](https://taylor.town/). His blog is a testament to the beauty of being nicheless; he writes about everything from creative writing to tech advice. His “now” page is a pleasure to read—simple, unfiltered, just like his posts. Or take [Taylor.Town](https://taylor.town/), where he explores topics as varied as philosophy, culture, and personal growth. Taylor’s posts often read like open-ended explorations, as he shares whatever topic grabs his interest, be it philosophy, work, or life reflections. These creators share for the sake of sharing, leaving breadcrumbs of their own lives and interests without worrying about hitting a niche. All of them keep alive the spirit of the old web, creating content meant for people, not algorithms.

Then there’s **100 Rabbits**, where Rekka and Devine document their off-grid life on a sailboat, creating open-source software, experimental games, and artwork all from the middle of the ocean. Their blog, [100r.co](https://100r.co/site/home.html), is a digital journey of self-reliance, sustainable design, and creativity, free from trends or expectations. It’s a beautifully unconventional space that feels like a throwback to the days when personal blogs were raw, exploratory, and full of surprises.

Recently, I was happy to see that Pieter Levels started a new, [playful blog project](https://pieter.com/), complete with a Minecraft server, to capture that same old-internet magic. His project is a nod to early online communities, reminding us of a time when blogs and web spaces were places of exploration, humor, and unfiltered creativity. His blog isn’t about promoting products or reaching metrics (at least this one, I hope so)—it’s about having a corner of the internet that’s just for fun, just for sharing, just because.

Blogs and creators like these inspire me to keep this space a place of pure, unstructured expression. They remind me that this blog doesn’t have to fit into a niche or follow trends; it can simply be a place to document my thoughts, connect with like-minded people, and leave a little of myself behind. Being nicheless isn’t just a choice—it’s a way of honoring the internet’s origins and keeping its authentic, person-centered spirit alive.

### Zero Resistance

Being nicheless gives a sense of freedom; it is my way of writing without any resistance or hesitance. Each time I start a post, I know there’s no checklist of topics to fit or tone to strike; I can just write. This blog is the one space in my life where I don’t have to answer to anyone’s rules. I don’t need to be a specialist or stick to a single theme. And I find that liberating.

The result? The excitement stays. Each time I post, it’s a new layer, a new spark, a new thread in this ongoing tapestry. I’m not just adding content; I’m creating a living, breathing digital diary that’s evolving right along with me.

### Rediscovering Myself

As I write, I’m discovering what truly interests me. I didn’t set out with a roadmap or destination, and that openness has led me to surprising intersections. This blog has become one of the main drivers of my life, nudging me to explore new skills and projects without worrying about where they’ll lead. In a way, it’s a mirror, reflecting parts of myself I hadn’t fully noticed. I’m excited to work on things that don’t need any clear purpose or meaning, trusting that these paths will intersect over time, guiding me to passions and ideas I couldn’t have anticipated.

Blogging has shown me that creating doesn’t have to be practical or profitable to be meaningful. Often, the most unexpected projects bring the greatest insights. My [Pixel Mosaic](/mosaic) project, for example, began as a fun experiment inspired by other blogs but evolved into a form of digital art that syncs in real time with my blog, bridging my digital and personal worlds. Lately, I’ve also been drawn to heraldry, inspired by a blog with a coat of arms in the footer. Designing my own feels both random and deeply meaningful, as if this blog nudges me to explore these old-world symbols and merge them with modern digital life. Projects like these have led me down paths I hadn’t planned, revealing new, fulfilling interests along the way.

What I value most is this ongoing process of rediscovery. The blog gives me permission to embrace odd fascinations and pursue projects that may not make sense to anyone else. It reminds me that life doesn’t have to follow a set plan and that some of the most rewarding experiences come from veering off the usual path. Each post, each project, each curiosity adds a layer, revealing parts of myself that might have stayed hidden without this space. This blog isn’t just a collection of ideas—it’s a map of my own self-discovery, where each random thought or interest has the potential to lead somewhere beautifully unexpected.

### A Quest for 1000 True Fans

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t care at all about having readers. But my aim isn’t mass appeal; it’s something more personal—a quest to find what Kevin Kelly called my ["1,000 True Fans".](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) Kelly’s idea is that you don’t need a massive audience, just a small tribe of people who genuinely resonate with your work. These are the readers who show up again and again, who follow your journey not because of any trend or SEO boost, but because something about your work speaks to them.

For me, this idea of true fans is like building a tribe—people who find value in the same quirks, the same unpredictable blend of topics I share. They’re readers who don’t mind the detours, the exploration of strange paths, or the deeply personal reflections. My tribe wouldn’t expect a single theme but would instead embrace the eclectic mix of ideas, projects, and insights that make this blog uniquely mine. They would come back for the story, the evolution, and the feeling of being part of something more personal, a digital space that reflects both the writer and the readers.

### A Place of My Own, Where Control Is Mine

As I had reflected in [_My Blog is My Greatest Art_](/blog-art/), this blog is more than a creative outlet; it’s one of the few spaces I have complete control over. I’m not bound by expectations to stay within one niche or limit myself to what’s “expected.” Here, I get to be the most authentic, most irreplaceable version of myself. I’m building something unique, even if it’s only for me. This isn’t just a blog; it’s a space for rediscovery, for keeping the spirit of personal creativity alive, and for finding joy in being nicheless.

If you’re reading this, I hope it inspires you to think about starting your own nicheless blog. It doesn’t matter if you don’t know where it’ll go or what it’ll become. Just let yourself write without boundaries, and see what beautiful intersections you uncover. And, if you need any help in setting up your blog or brainstorming ideas, [reach out](/contact). I always respond!
