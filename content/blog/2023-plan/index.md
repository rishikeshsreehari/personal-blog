As the year 2022 comes to a close, I look back to see how I’ve done and set more meaningful goals for 2023. Inspired by interesting creators and personalities online, 2022 was the first year of my life in which I made a rough plan for the year ahead. Even though I didn't achieve everything I aimed for, I'm still happy that I had some direction. [As I did in 2022](https://rishikeshs.com/2022-planning/), the main areas of 2023 planning will revolve around health, wealth, and career. Unlike 2022, where I tried many things and hoped for the best, this year I'm embracing with a lot of clarity. Thus, 2023 is a year of execution where I stick to my principles and routine. I’ve also decided to take fewer things on my plate to make this plan more sustainable.

Instead of doing a separate blog post about last year's review, I thought of including the same in this year's plan. To sum up, the 3 main highlights of 2022 were:

1. Switching my career to a field that I'm interested in at the intersection of data, sustainability, and writing.
2. Getting engaged to my girlfriend and one step closer to getting married.
3. Becoming a super randonneur by completing 200, 300, 400, and 600-kilometer cycle rides in a calendar year.

## Goals for 2023

1. To be fit and healthy by the end of 2023.
2. Create a consistent recurring passive income by the end of 2023.
3. Continue learning to code and create a portfolio by the end of the year.

## Objectives

To achieve the goals mentioned, the following objectives have been laid out. Some of these objectives are interconnected and contribute to more than one of the goals.

### 🏋 Weight

The goal for 2023 is to end the year at a healthy weight of 65, which puts me in the normal range on the BMI scale. Last year, I had a similar goal and reached 67 kgs by August but failed miserably as the year came to a close.

### 🛌 Sleep

My goal for this year is to have an average of 7 hours of sleep throughout the year. I struggled to track sleep effectively last year, and I’m looking for better solutions to track it without a wearable device.

### 🚴 Cycling

The goal for 2023 is to **ride 4000 km in Delhi** and complete a few 200 km rides. Last year, my goal was 6000 km, and I finished the year with 5,642 km despite relocating.

### 🏃‍♂️ Running

My goal for 2023 is to **run a total of 600 km** and complete a half marathon.

### 🏊‍♂️ Swimming

The goal for 2023 is to swim at least once a week and **clock 30 km of swimming distances by the end of the year**.

### 🧘‍♂️ Meditation

In 2023, the goal is to remaster the art of meditation and end the year with **at least 220 mindful days** with at least 10 minutes of meditation each day.

### ⏲ Fasting

The goal for 2023 is **to fast for a total of 4000 hours**, with an aim of five 16-hour fasts per week.

### 🍲 Diet

For 2023, the goal is to have **65% of days with less than 2000-calorie consumption**. I will also focus on a balanced, protein-rich diet on training days.

### 🍺 Alcohol

I've set a monetary goal of **a maximum of 15,000 INR (~$180) spent on alcohol this year**.

### 💻 Programming

The goal is to **master Python** by completing all exercises on Exercism and attending a full-stack Python Bootcamp. I also plan to dive into **AI/ML** and enhance my skills in **energy and power system modeling** tools like PyPSA.

### 🎨 Art

In 2023, I aim to **complete at least 2 photography projects** and publish them on my portfolio.

### 📰 Newsletter

The goal is to **hit 4000 subscribers** by the end of the year. I will explore ways to go paid with a solid plan for 2024.

### ✍️ Blogging

I aim to **publish 20 blog posts** in 2023.

### 📚 Reading

The goal is to **read 30 books** by the end of the year.

### 💸 Side Hustles

The goal for 2023 is to **generate a total passive income of 3,60,000 INR (~$4300)** by the end of 2023.

### 💰 Emergency Fund

I aim to **set up an emergency fund of at least 3 months** by the end of 2023.

### 💰 Investment Portfolio Risk Management

The goal for 2023 is to **reduce my crypto exposure to less than 10%** and have at least 20% of assets as cash for liquidity.

## Final Thoughts

As mentioned earlier, I had too much on my plate in 2022, which often left me feeling out of focus. This year, I want to avoid that and move forward with more clarity. I’m in a much better headspace in terms of career and life direction. It's all about consistent execution this year, and I hope to write a much more positive and happy report in 2024.

Happy New Year!
