While Jordan was never on my bucket list or something, we (me and my wife) were looking for a nice destination to travel to. Jordan came up as one of the cheap options on Skyscanner. When I bought my laptop earlier this year, I had accumulated some Air Arabia points and we managed to get a pretty good decent deal flying from Abu Dhabi.

While I didn't know much about Jordan apart from Petra and Dead Sea, reading some travel blogs and reviews on Reddit made me excited as the trip approached. I had a rough itinerary in my mind, but wanted to keep the trip flexible with more of a chill vibe.

## Day 1 - Amman

We started from Abu Dhabi towards Amman on an Air Arabia flight. Nothing special, but weird part was even water was not free on flight. I'm not sure if it's a universal thing, but at least in India, they provide water in cups for free. We landed to slightly warm weather in Amman (better than Abu Dhabi's scorching summer!).

There was a small section for people with Jordan Pass and they issued a visa on arrival. We proceeded to immigration. Immigration was smooth but the lady at the counter was skeptical probably due to the fact that I look quite different from my passport. She contacted her supervisor and I showed him my other IDs and all good to go.


We saw currency exchanges at the airport, but found that the exchange rate was worse than what we got in Abu Dhabi at Lulu exchange. I wanted to take a local SIM and took Umniah SIM card. Not sure if it's the best based on reviews, but throughout my trip I never faced any issues. It cost me 10 JOD for 35 GB of data for 10 days along with 100 minutes of local call and 20 minutes international.

Off towards exit and we checked the rates towards our Airbnb and found that the airport taxi was 5 JOD cheaper than what was showing on Careem/Uber. Taxi ride was smooth except the fact that the guy wanted us to hire him for the next couple of days to show around, usual tourist BS. Prices were ridiculous and we prefer to use public transport as much as possible.
The Airbnb was super good, on top floor in a residential area, sadly there were no lifts. But the host had mentioned this before confirming. Went down to get some stuff like drinking water, snacks and some eggs for breakfast for the next couple of days. Communication was an issue with the shopkeeper, but sign language works. Also local shops take only cash.


Freshened up and went to the city for a food tour I had booked earlier. The guy had confirmed our availability and sent the starting location earlier. We reached 10 minutes late thanks to heavy traffic in downtown Amman at 7pm but the Careem ride was smooth.

Ossamah took us around the city showing various spots, through small streets, souqs (markets), suggested great restaurants for falafel, makluba, mansaf and kunafah. I think Amman is known as city of steps, so if you are traveling, be ready to climb up and down a lot of steps. The trip ended in Rainbow Street, we grabbed some Petra beers and off to the guide's house for a nice dinner. The food was so yummy. We walked back to Rainbow Street, grabbed some more beer and went back to our Airbnb.

## Day 2 - Amman City

SStarted the day a bit late, had a couple of eggs and left the Airbnb by 12PM. Decided to visit the Amman Citadel early even though it is recommended to visit during sunset. Couple of guides approached us at the entrance, but decided against it. Entry was free since we had Jordan Pass. It was pretty hot, but manageable. Walked around the citadel, visited the museum and it was fun. It's sort of ruins but still you can imagine. Wanted to see the Hercules hand, but couldn't find it at first but eventually found it. Truly gives you a perspective of how big those statues were.

The power of 4 boiled eggs was slightly diminishing and I was super hungry. Decided to go to Al-Quds which Ossamah had recommended. Decided to walk towards the restaurant since it was closer. On the way stumbled upon an art gallery by an artist called Mohammed Turky. Grabbed a small pastel art piece from him for 35 JOD for our home in Abu Dhabi. He packed it nicely and his studio was quite nice.

Finally reached Al Quds and ordered Lamb Mansaf (6.5 JOD). The olive pickles they gave were quite good. Since my wife is a vegetarian, the only option she has in most Arabic restaurants are the usuals - hummus, muttabel, falafel, etc. She ordered hummus and muttabel and it was good, but not as tasty as what Ossamah had cooked at his home yesterday. I guess home cooked food always wins. Mansaf was good, but I guess I'm not a great fan of that milky taste thanks to jameed - the traditional dried hardened yogurt. The meat was tasty, but I realized I'm more of a Maqluba kind of guy. Just a note, Al Quds does not accept cards and takes only cash.

Done with lunch and decided to roam around the city. Wife had loved Arabic ice cream at Bekdash. I'm not a great fan of ice cream but it tasted good. She had the chocolate version and I had a couple of spoons of that. Done with the ice cream and decided to roam around the city. Saw some nice street art and graffiti and decided to visit BooksAtCafe. It's a cozy cafe with some outdoor seating, had Petra beer there staring at the city.

Beer ended fast and we decided to visit the Roman Theatre. Took a cab and reached Roman Theatre. Climbed up the stairs while the sun was slowly setting. A beautiful perspective of how grand the city was in its prime. Apparently some artists have performed here and I think Amman marathon ends here. Walked down the steps and decided to visit the famous Hashem restaurant.
On the way, grabbed a cup of sweet corn from a street vendor, it was decent, but nothing wow. Reached Hashem, it was not packed but mostly occupied. They have a very simple menu where you write the quantity and pass it to the waiter. Ordered hummus, falafel and foul beans. The food was good, loved the foul beans especially. They accept card so no issue with payments.

We were full, kinda tired and decided to end the day as it was almost 8PM. Took a cab home, chilled for sometime on the rooftop having a beer, overlooking the city.

## Day 3 - Jerash

We both are not early risers, and I woke up around 9 AM. Slowly started the day, had boiled eggs as usual and left home around 10:30 AM. Kinda late, but who cares, it's a vacation. Instead of a cab we had decided to take public transport to Jerash. Booked Careem to the North bus station and there we found a bus/tempo to Jerash. See one problem with starting the day slow on a shared bus is that these buses don't have a fixed time. When it's full they leave, so had to wait around 1 hour for the bus to be full. The wait was long but thankfully the station had a toilet which you can use by paying. Once the bus was full, the driver started. It's pretty cheap, just 1 JOD. Reached Jerash in approximately an hour.


It was hot and we sort of regretted not having hats. Showed our Jordan Pass and we entered the Jerash ruins. Saw few street sellers selling stuff, wife decided to buy a shawl(5 JOD) to cover her head from the heat. Couldn't find a hat for me, so I covered my forehead with a handkerchief.

Walked around the ruins, one seller was pretending to be super friendly and I sensed a scam. He took photos of us, made us dance with a guy who played something that looked like bagpipes. The bagpipe guy asked for a tip. Usually I walk away with a poker face, but traveling with wife is difficult, so she gave him some money. The dude who took our photographs showed his shop and wanted us to buy some overpriced shit. Decided against it and he started demanding money. We didn't want to make a scene so gave him a tip, such an asshole.

Walked around the ruins, saw these pillars which move. I wish there was a  fixed trail or a map, something they can give us at the reception to follow. We walked around for a couple of hours, clicked some photos. After a while, was sort of done with the ruins and decided to go back. We both were super hungry and decided to visit this restaurant called Old Site Restaurant. We took the buffet as the Ala Carte was expensive and the food was not that good. Reviews online were quite good, but yeah, typical food you can expect right next to a tourist spot. Won't recommend.

On the way back, we found another travel hack. Instead of these shared buses, we can take a shared taxi for just 2 JOD and it fills fast since you need only 4 people. Got one immediately and off to Amman. The guy dropped us at North bus station and we were tired and badly needed a shower. Took a cab home and on the way Ossamah messaged me asking whether we want to meet for a couple of drinks.

Freshened up a bit at our Airbnb, then off to Ossamah's place to hang out. Had great conversations with some awesome snacks they made and reached back home quite late around 1-ish, dreading the early bus to Petra tomorrow.


## Day 4 - Amman to Wadi Musa

Woke up pretty early, quite cranky, thanks to yesterday's late night and only a couple of hours of sleep. We had booked a JETT bus that leaves for Petra at 7AM from the 7th Circle office. Quickly cleaned up the Airbnb and took a cab to the office. Reached there on time but the bus was slightly late. The office has toilets for passengers to use. The bus was full and I tried to sleep during the journey. In between they stopped at a place for refreshment, typical scam place where things have very high marked up tourist prices. Couldn't believe my eyes when I saw some American tourists buying very overpriced stuff without even thinking. Maybe they are quite rich. Even overheard another group being brought here by their tour driver, saying this place you can trust. One benchmark I use is find something that is common in the country and compare the price with what you get it in the city. For instance, these Dead Sea masks are quite common in Jordan in all shops. In the city it was 1 JOD but at this place, it was 5 JOD. So you can imagine.
\
Reached Petra on time and we were hungry, sleepy and tired. There was no Careem to rescue, and the taxi drivers were telling exorbitant prices to reach our hotel. It started at 10 JOD, but ended up bargaining to 3 JOD after some pretending to walk back trick. Sometimes being an Indian helps.

Reached hotel, a very cozy hotel run by a guy called Yousef. Check-in was smooth and the rooms were spacious. Took a shower and then decided to have some lunch and withdraw some money. There is this city centre sort of place with a couple of ATMs. It costs 3.5 JOD for each withdrawal barring other fees. My wife wanted to have some comfort food, I guess she was bored with the usual hummus, falafel, bread trio. Went to a place called Elan restaurant. I think my wife was craving some good food and made the stupid decision of ordering a margherita which turned out to be bad. I ordered Maqluba which turned out to be really good. Wife was disappointed, I was sort of happy. Grabbed some water, snacks for tomorrow and also a hat for myself.
Off to the room and we decided to take a nap since we were sleep deprived. And this turned out to be a mistake. Our initial plan was to visit Little Petra today, but realized late that the shuttle to Little Petra ends at 3:30 PM. Nevertheless decided to walk to the visitor centre, the guy was helpful. We asked a guy to show us around and he took us to Little Petra and to a nice viewpoint. Little Petra was good and the viewpoint as well. But nothing special you know. And weirdly, the taxi driver was a cousin of the owner of our hotel. I think 50 JOD we spent for this trip was not worth it and was a mistake. But we had nothing to do for the evening and this was the only option.
Reached back to the hotel and decided to go out for dinner. Wife selected a place called Juniper Falafel. It served only vegetarian stuff, so she ordered and I decided to eat somewhere else. Met an Italian couple living in Berlin at the restaurant. Had a small chat and it was fun. Once we were done there, decided to walk further to find a restaurant for me to have dinner.

Went to a restaurant called Al Wadi restaurant. Nice cozy restaurant with outdoor seating. I decided to order camel meat for dinner as I never had it before. Tastes more like a mix of beef and lamb, but has a weird smell. Quickly finished my dinner and had a short chat with a waiter who was from Pakistan. In Jordan we rarely saw desi people and it was nice short chat.
Done with dinner and decided to retire early since we were planning to start the hike to Petra at 6:30 AM.


## Day 5 - Petra

We both had a great night's sleep and woke up fresh. We had sort of a breakfast/lunch pack provided by the hotel owner for the hike (5 JOD). Decided to walk to the visitor entrance since it was all downhill. Original plan was to start the hike at 6:30 AM when the gates open but started at 7AM. Walked a few steps and were greeted by some folks who offered to take us to the Siq on a horse. Even though it is included in the ticket price, decided against it - one, we wanted to walk and two, mostly this ends up as a tipping scam. Entered the Siq, it was very quiet with maximum 7-10 people ahead. Slowly walked enjoying the change in landscape, and it was not too hot. Walked ahead and finally saw the Treasury and it was just phenomenal. While pictures capture the beauty of it, the grandeur of such a structure inside a canyon can only be witnessed by eyes. Clicked a few pics and we walked ahead. No issues with network also so far. There are also toilets along the trail, you can spot them easily if you have a map (grab one from the visitor centre). Done with the Treasury and decided to go to the Monastery. You will meet a lot of folks on the way telling you to take a donkey/mule to reach the Monastery, but in my opinion that's not really necessary. If you are relatively fit, you can slowly walk and reach there. Reached Monastery and it was quiet. Enjoyed the beauty of it and decided to walk ahead to find a quiet spot for having lunch. Found a nice place overlooking the cliffs and had our packed lunch. It was decent, with some sandwiches, juice, apple, banana, boiled egg, cucumber and a tomato. I never knew people eat raw tomatoes just like that other than in salad. A cat followed us and gave us company. Chilled there for a while and decided to walk back.

Slowly walked back, a lady had pinky promised me to visit her stall on the way back. Visited her small shop, she offered tea and we sat down for a while. We were not interested in buying anything and we tipped her for the tea. Followed the trail back and rested for a bit at one of the restaurants while having coffee. For some reason we decided to take the High Place of Sacrifice trail from the backside (Qasr Al Bint). We didn't know this at that time but most people take this trail from the Treasury and walk down on the way we hiked up. Trail was not too tricky but a bit of a long walk up but beautiful sceneries throughout. There were very few shops and we were the only ones hiking up from this side. Reached the High Place of Sacrifice, the view was great, but yeah the place of sacrifice was a let down. But the monoliths were spectacular. Spent some time there, were offered some fossils, rocks and some coins by vendors. All except the rocks are fake. Walked down, reached the theatre area and met an Indian couple we had met earlier. Decided to walk with them to visit some more tombs, the church and some other places. Was pretty much tired by this point, having walked close to 18kms. Decided to take the shuttle to visitor centre and it's a 15 min walk from where we were. Got into the shuttle and they make a pitstop at a so-called heritage village filled with souvenir shops run by locals. 15 mins of waiting and we were back at the visitor centre.

I was cranky since I didn't eat much so decided to grab a quick meal. Went to a restaurant with the coolest name I have ever seen 'My Mom's Recipe Restaurant'. I checked with the waiter how big the portions were and he assured that it was small. Ordered something called a Chicken Sagieh (10 JOD), more like chicken boneless pieces with onions, sweet peppers, chilli and olive oil. It was yummy but the portion was too big. Packed the leftover and off to the hotel. We had pre-booked a homely meal at the hotel itself, cooked by the owner's wife. The dinner was good, but I was too full, but managed to eat some mandi rice, falafel, hummus, fried eggplants and other stuff. Was too full, but I was in a mood to have beer, so opened a can of Amstel I had on hand, snacking on the leftover chicken sagieh. I guess I hit my protein goal for the day. Apparently the Amstel here which is brewed locally is better than the Dutch version. Had the beer and went to bed as we had booked a bus to Wadi Rum village next day morning.



## Day 6 - Wadi Rum

If you don't have your own transport, there is this local bus that takes people from Wadi Musa to Wadi Rum every day at 6:30 AM. It's a shared bus run by a guy called Wahid and if you talk to your hotel reception, you can arrange a pickup right from the hotel itself. Boarded the bus and it was sort of packed. It was foggy in the morning and we started our journey. The bus stopped in between for a 15 min refreshment break and I grabbed an Arabic coffee takeaway. I'm not the greatest fan of Arabic coffee but I guess it's an acquired taste and I'm starting to like it. So it costs 10 JOD to Wadi Rum from Wadi Musa. We were planning to head to Amman from Wadi Rum and the guy suggested we take his bus to Amman from Wadi Rum. This sounded like a good deal and we booked 2 seats for both of us (20 JOD each). We had explored private taxis and these were quite expensive and this sounded like a solid plan.

Reached Wadi Rum and scanned our Jordan Pass for the entry. We got down from the bus and were picked up by our camp guy. So we booked with a camp called Bedouin Nights Camp. I'm not entirely sure but I'm assuming that all camps are more or less the same, except the cool Martian ones that are quite expensive. But don't get fooled by the very cheap prices you see on booking.com for all camps. It is true that lodging is very less, but you would need a 4x4 jeep to reach most camps from the visitor centre. Also what would you do in a camp without taking a tour. So better to take an all-inclusive sort of package. We paid 65 JOD each for a full day tour of Wadi Rum, 3 meals, transportation and stay. We were taken to a small lobby of the camp and were offered tea and we relaxed a bit. Met a guy from Spain who was volunteering and living with locals for a couple of weeks. We also met 2 Italian guys, one of them staying with us in the camp and the other touring with us during the day.

The tour was good, taking us around visiting a couple of spots like Lawrence's Spring, huge sand dunes, a place with inscriptions, a couple of rock bridges, Jebel Khaz'ali Canyon, mushroom rock, etc. The scenery was spectacular and many movies were shot in Wadi Rum. The ones I know are Martian, Dune and Goat Life. When we were walking through the canyon, it truly felt like we were walking in Arrakis as in the Dune movie. The guide stopped at a secluded place and then prepared lunch for us. We had also option to do sandboarding at one point but were too lazy to do it. After this, the guide drove us to a very nice place to watch the sunset and we were off to the camp for the night.

When we reached the camp, I was shocked seeing the amenities. I think they can accommodate up to 32 people, but we were the only 3 guests at that time. The tents were quite good with proper bedding and flooring. The bathroom complex which is shared was also nice with hot showers and clean amenities. One thing I was surprised about these camps was how low-key they were and were not causing much light pollution. Having visited desert camps in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan in India, this was quite peaceful. All lights were shaded down to reduce light pollution with warm lights and some of them were also motion controlled.


The guide called us for dinner at around 8PM, and showed us the chicken and veggies being cooked/grilled underground in a pit. The dinner was good, typical Arabic dinner with hummus, grilled meat, vegetables, etc. Post dinner, they even offered us an option to sleep under the stars in a cave, but we politely declined it. It was too cold to be honest. Sat with the Bedouin folks around fire sipping tea discussing about their life. After a while, another guy who welcomed us at the lobby back in the village joined the camp. It was a clear night and we moved to an outdoor seating for stargazing. We could see the Milky Way and it was a magical moment for my wife as she was seeing it for the first time. We saw so many meteors and it felt magical. Sat there for 10-15 minutes and decided to go inside, since it was getting too cold and we had no warm clothes. The guy told us that in desert 4 hour sleep is equivalent to 8 hour sleep in the city. Bit skeptical on that part, but let's see. On to the room, got under the warm blankets and dozed off.

## Day 6 - Wadi Rum to Amman

We woke up to a very well rested sleep. Maybe the guy was right. Quickly freshened up and had breakfast buffet offered at the camp. The owner and another guy at the camp were kinda pissed at the bus guy who dropped us yesterday for us booking with him for the ride back to Amman. The owner was suggesting a taxi ride earlier to Aqaba with another guy but we politely declined. Not sure what the drama was, but probably the loss of business. We were dropped off at the visitor centre and the bus driver confirmed that the camp guys were mad at him and he heard a mouthful. None of our business, clarified that we didn't confirm to anyone and it is our choice to take whatever transport we prefer. He also agreed and we started our journey. While the journey was cheap, there was a caveat. The bus we boarded doesn't go to Amman directly but he had arranged with some other bus guy. Not much chaos, we were dropped at a petrol station and he waited with us until the bus arrived. Got into that bus and we were on to Amman. When the map was showing 20 minutes to reach Amman we were asked to board another bus and we were dropped near the bus station. Couple of hops on and off, but everything was smooth.

We took a cab to the famous Battuta hostel in Amman where we had booked a private room. Check-in was smooth and the hostel felt quite nice. The common areas were good, there was even a small health centre/gym and also coworking spaces with a cafe on top. So the hostel also organizes day tours and we can put a pin on a common notice board and the price decreases based on the number of people who sign up for the tour. So we placed 2 pins for the day tour to Dead Sea and Madaba. Placing pins were not a commitment and before they confirm they would call us for a final confirmation. The prices were quite good and one more guy was interested to join the trip so it was coming to approximately 35 JOD per person with 5 JOD extra for lunch buffet. This includes the resort entry to Dead Sea (Sea Gate Resort), lunch buffet and cab with driver.

We relaxed at the room for a while and then decided to go to downtown again. My wife had this idea of trying Indian/Pakistani food and we ended up eating from a place that was not so good. Went again to Bekdash for ice cream and returned to hotel to relax. Relaxed again for a while and at 9 left again for downtown for dinner and had plans to meet Ossamah again. Went to a place called Faisal Cafe with outdoor seating and had Maqluba again. It was quite nice, then roamed around shopping for some souvenirs and other stuff for taking back home. Got some beers again and went to Ossamah's place to chill. It was so nice to meet him again (and his wife) and had a great time chilling there. It was getting late and returned to hostel around 2AM.


## Day 7 - Dead Sea & Mt. Nebo

The driver picked us up on time from the hotel for the day trip. We had one more guy from Spain with us for the trip. The driver suggested we go to Dead Sea first as the temperature would be much better in the morning. He was a bit talkative, but bearable. On the way he made us visit yet another souvenir shop to check out the stuff. Mostly these folks get commission if they bring tourists. 3 of us didn't buy anything and we reached the resort. They had to scan our passports before we enter (remember to take your passports if you are visiting a Dead Sea resort). It was a very new resort which mostly operates for tourists with day pass. There were also a few villas but these were expensive. Were offered towels and shown the changing room. Not the best, but bearable and we went down to the sea shore. We could see Jerusalem from this side and there was also a lifeguard. We entered the water and it felt slimy. I tasted the water and immediately regretted it. It felt as if I was chewing on a rotten battery. I had a few cuts on my body and it was burning due to the salt. I don't know how to explain the feeling but it felt like something slimy was stuck on my body after I took a dip. We could also see salt crystals all along the shore. I tried floating and it truly works. But it's safe to float on your back. Swimming is a bit hard due to the extra buoyancy and it takes a bit to adjust. If water enters your eyes you are screwed, it hurts like hell.



The lifeguard had an earthen pot with some mud to be applied as a mud spa. It was 2 JOD per person, not sure if it's a scam, but didn't want to argue. Applied it on our body and waited 15 minutes for it to dry. Then took a dip again to wash it off and showered. Then we moved up to chill by the pool. The pool was nice with lounge beds next to it. Weirdly for some reason the umbrella fell on us after a while and we were pissed. Decided to change to dry clothes and have lunch since the buffet was ready. The food was basic, typical shitty buffet food you expect. But water we had to pay extra, decided not to pay and used our own water. Ossama had recommended nice resort called Grand East Resort & Spa, so if you are going on your own vehicle, this is a great place apparently. Had lunch quickly and left for Mt. Nebo.

Reached Mt. Nebo and then realized we had to pay extra to enter the church as it was not included in Jordan Pass. Decided against it and drove around and finally the driver took us to one of those mosaic workshops which is famous in Madaba. The process of making the mosaic art is quite cool, but the shop was a tourist scam. Very overpriced. Didn't buy anything and then we got dropped in Madaba. Such a beautiful city, gives me sort of Croatian vibes. We wanted to stay here for the last day but many people advised against it stating it was boring. We loved it and maybe next time we will stay here.

Visited a local restaurant that serves beer and had Karakale. It was nice to chill for a while. Walked around and visited the archaeological park, Apostles Church, etc. Madaba is called city of Mosaics and we saw some ancient mosaic floorings in multiple places. Roamed around for a while and it was quite interesting. Madaba has this old city vibe that I cannot explain in words. Had a pomegranate juice for refreshment and it was quite tasty. Back to hostel and we relaxed for a while.
Went out for dinner, first for pizza then I had a very nice shawarma from Shawarma Reem. It was tasty, but later realized they also have a branch in Abu Dhabi :D. Went to downtown again for one last shopping for some souvenirs, grabbed some sweets from Habibah and back to the hostel. Cleaned up quick, booked a taxi via Careem and reached Amman airport. Check-in was crowded and our flight was delayed by an hour.

I also wanted to visit Wadi Mujib, but didn't have time. Maybe I'll keep it for another trip.

Yet another wonderful trip I would cherish for a long time. This was our first long trip post our wedding other than the honeymoon. It was also nice to do a bit of backpacking and having some local experiences.

I loved Jordan and Amman in particular. The city has this vibe that makes you visit it again. I'm sure one day I will visit Amman again.

You can also read some notes and observations on Jordan here.
