{{< dropcap >}} 2021 was a crazy year by all means. Learning from past mistakes, I decided to create a proper plan for 2022, something I’ve never done in the [27 years of my life](https://rishikeshs.com/27-lessons/). Even though I love working on different goals or projects at the same time, this can often be hectic and quite inefficient. The idea here is to create a plan for 2022 so that I have a clear vision of the things I’m pursuing. I do not plan to take up anything extra other than what I’ve mentioned in this plan. This planning will also act as a skeleton for the long-form article I’m working on, revolving around the concept of ‘How to Live’. The overall vision for 2022 is to achieve the goals defined based on the three focus points I have for the year: Health, Career, and Wealth.{{< /dropcap >}}

## Goals {#goals}

- To be fit and healthy by the end of 2022.
- Create alternate work streams and passive income by the end of 2022.
- Master programming and transition my career into a more data-oriented one.

## Objectives {#objectives}

To achieve the goals mentioned in the previous section, the following objectives have been laid out. Some of these objectives are interconnected and contribute to more than one of the goals.

#### [🏋](https://emojikeyboard.org/copy/Person_Lifting_Weights_Emoji_%F0%9F%8F%8B?utm_source=extlink) Weight {#weight}

At the time of writing this post, my weight is 70 kgs, putting me slightly in the obese range on the BMI scale. I have shed close to 6 kgs in the last month, but by the end of 2022, **I want to achieve a target weight of 65 kgs.** I’m tracking this progress on Google Fit as well as the Zepp app.

#### 🛌 Sleep {#sleep}

Last year, I read enough about the importance of sleep, and it’s quite evident from scientific literature that human beings need close to 7-8 hours of sleep, irrespective of what hustle gurus say. Having a consistent sleep schedule is important as it balances the circadian rhythm. **My plan is to sleep around 11 PM every night and wake up at around 6 AM every day, along with a 30-minute nap in the afternoon.** I would love to track my sleep, but whenever I wear my fitness tracker while sleeping, it’s quite uncomfortable and affects my sleep quality. For now, I’m tracking my sleep in a habit tracker on a Google Sheet! (I have some ideas for developing an obstruction-free fitness tracker. If you work in that space or would love to build one, do ping me!)

#### 🚴 Cycling {#cycling}

I rode around 3000 kms in 2021. I recently purchased a road bike, and I’m planning to take cycling seriously this year. **In 2022, I plan to ride a minimum of 6000 km.** I love long-distance cycling/randonneuring and plan to compete in 200 and 300 BRMs this year. So far, I’ve completed 600+ km and am well on track. Follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/67526871) to see what I’m up to!

#### 🏃‍♂️ Running {#running}

I’ve always wanted to run but never committed to it. So the plan this year is to start slow and work towards being fit enough to **participate in a half marathon event or complete a virtual half marathon by the end of this year.** At the time of writing, I can run 5k comfortably and am working on building endurance for a 10k.

#### 🏊‍♂️ Swimming {#swimming}

I learned proper swimming at the end of last year and have decided to dedicate **2 days a week to swimming**. My goal is to **swim continuously for 800 meters by the end of the year.** Swimming is new for me, so I haven’t set any ambitious targets here. This training will help me gain confidence in open-water swimming, a plan I have for 2023.

#### 🧘‍♂️ Meditation {#meditation}

As Naval Ravikant said, meditation is the art of doing nothing. I’ve been using [Waking Up](https://wakingup.com/) by Sam Harris for meditating. Last year I logged 120 mindful days, accounting for a total of 2000+ minutes of meditation. **The goal for 2022 is to move away from the app and start practicing unguided meditation every day for 20 minutes.**

#### ⏲ Fasting {#fasting}

I tried intermittent fasting during the second half of last year, and it worked wonders for me. I love the concept of fasting as it gives me so much energy throughout the day. **I plan to continue 16/8 fasting with two 24-hour fasts each month, aiming for at least 4500 hours of fasting by the end of the year.** I’m also thinking of developing an app to track fasting more easily using an NFC tag.

#### 🍲 Diet {#diet}

I aim to cut down on outside food this year and eat more meals at home. My goal is to **follow a diet with zero added sugar, more fiber, seasonal produce, fatty fish, lean meats, least processed, colorful (more antioxidants), and fermented foods.** I also plan to take a 60-day no-sugar challenge in May 2022.

#### 🍺 Alcohol {#alcohol}

I’ve been drinking socially since 2013, but lately, I’ve noticed that alcohol affects my sleep and digestion. Even a single pint of beer gives me a hangover. **The goal this year is to drink as little as possible and stay hydrated.**

#### 💻 Programming {#programming}

I’ve always felt like I missed the bus when it comes to programming. This year, I’ve decided to stop complaining and master it. **My goal is to learn Python, master data science basics, and transition into a data-oriented career.** I also want to **learn JavaScript and write smart contracts** to stay updated with Web 3.0 developments. By the end of 2022, I want to create a portfolio for university applications and job hunts.

#### 🎨 Art {#art}

Creating art gives purpose to my life. I want to focus more on art in 2022, aiming to **create a portfolio of at least 3 art projects**. Some of my planned projects include "Abandoned Gods," "Memoirs of an ALS Patient," and an NFT project involving generative art.

#### 📰 Newsletter {#newsletter}

My newsletter, [10+1 Things](https://rishikesh.substack.com/), exceeded my expectations and crossed 700 subscribers in 2021. **The goal for 2022 is to reach 2000 subscribers.** I’m also open to cross-promotion opportunities, so feel free to connect!

#### ✍️ Blogging {#blogging}

I aim to publish **a minimum of 30 original blog posts** by the end of 2022. I’ve also got a list of 75+ ideas to explore. I plan to migrate my blog to a fully custom static site based on the Eleventy framework by year-end.

#### 📚 Reading {#reading}

I failed to meet my target of 52 books in 2021, ending with 33 books. This year, I aim to **read a minimum of 45 books.**

#### 🎓 Theoretical Physics and Interaction Design {#learning}

Apart from programming, I’m pursuing theoretical physics and interaction design. **The goal for 2022 is to complete a course on classical mechanics in theoretical physics and finish a UX design course on IDF.**

#### 💸 Side Hustles {#side-hustles}

I plan to **generate at least 50,000 INR (~$670) per month from side hustles** by the end of the year, mainly through sponsorships, freelancing, and a course I’m developing.

#### 💰 Emergency Fund {#emergency-fund}

One of my biggest mistakes in 2021 was traveling without an emergency fund. **I aim to build an emergency fund by the end of the year that will cover 6 months of expenses.**

#### 💰 Portfolio Risk Management {#portfolio-management}

My portfolio is currently 35% cryptocurrency, which is a huge risk. I aim to **minimize my crypto investments to 20% and allocate more to debt instruments** to reduce risk.

#### 💭 Other Objectives {#other-objectives}

Aside from my main objectives, I also plan to increase my earning potential, relocate to Europe with my partner, and set up a business for my mother. Additionally, I want to improve our front yard and build a small vegetable garden.

## Final Thoughts {#final-thoughts}

A wise man once said that you should always have a plan, irrespective of the timeline. I may or may not achieve these goals by the end of 2022, but this plan gives me perspective and focus. At the end of 2022, I’ll update you on the status of all these objectives with a year-end review. While I thrive on pursuing multiple things at once, I believe that magic happens at the intersection of these wild pursuits. I’m excited to experience those "aha" moments in 2022!
