I came to know about the concept of Resonance Journal when I watched Ali Abdaalâ€™s video on how he uses [Notion for keeping his resonance calendar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYBB-Uw1IM). After watching the video, I felt like the term â€˜Resonance Calendarâ€™ was not apt for what I wanted to achieve. I decided to rename it as [Resonance Journal](https://dent-radar-d40.notion.site/2615af7fb932434c9085b4c666781d20?v=089ad185b9354ae49ab8b26ef844a214) and set up one similar to Ali on Notion. I currently use the Resonance Journal as a tool in my journey towards self-discovery.

> Anytime I come across anything at all that resonates with me, I drop it into the Resonance Calendar on Notion. This lets me keep track of articles Iâ€™ve read, YouTube videos Iâ€™ve watched, books and podcasts Iâ€™ve listened to, and anything else I come across in life.

## How does it work?

The concept is simple. Every time you come across a video, podcast, job, article, book, project, etc., that resonates with you, add it as an entry to the Resonance Journal. Use the existing tags or create one if it doesnâ€™t exist. Over time, you will notice patterns or common threads of things that resonate with you. Some items often resonate with you and have multiple entries in the journal. For example, I came across articles, blogs, and personalities centered around human-centered design a lot in my journal. Interestingly, there were very few entries related to renewable energy, which was my major! ðŸ™‚

## Self-Discovery using Resonance Journal

I have always struggled with figuring out what I wanted to do in life. Iâ€™ve always wanted to work on something Iâ€™m truly passionate about, especially in terms of a career since it occupies a major part of life. Journaling about things that resonate with me has positively impacted my self-discovery journey. I realized that what I thought mattered to me or what I thought fit me wasnâ€™t always something I had a true connection with. Through this process, I found interesting patterns and repeatedly encountered multiple personalities in different contexts. 

At the time of writing this, Iâ€™m currently doing a program on Design Research by the [Interaction Design Foundation (IDF)](https://www.interaction-design.org/invite?r=rishikesh-2). This is something I discovered after journaling for a few months in the Resonance Journal. I noticed several instances where I felt deeply connected to design research, such as works by [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com/), [Acumen Academy](https://acumenacademy.org/), [Space10](https://space10.com/), and [Don Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman). Every time I read about something related to UX, like design research or interaction design, I felt a strong connection and was excited to learn more. Whatâ€™s funny is that these were the same topics that excited me two years ago, but I dismissed them as mere curiosity cravings. I donâ€™t know if this is the right or wrong path, but Iâ€™m happy to pursue something that resonates with me rather than doing something accidentally.
