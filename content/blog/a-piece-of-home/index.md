I was a bit late to discover this month's Indieweb carnival topic, but when I saw it was about colors, I knew I had to write something. As someone born and raised in India, colors(i'm used to writing it Colours, but i will stick with colors for now). is a topic that hits closely to home. I mean, when you think of India, I bet the immediate picture you would have in your mind is those vibrant colors. 

I'm from Kerala, a coastal state in South India, that's squeezed between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats. It's basically tropical paradise, and yes, our tourism department literally calls it "God's Own Country" (cheesy marketing, but worked really well).

And the color that defines my entire childhood?
The lush green of monsoon season in Kerala.

Not just any green though, I'm talking about the specific shade that appears when monsoon hits our coast and literally transform everything into this explosion of green within days. All my best childhood memories are in this color - running around in the rain picking mangoes, getting completely soaked, watching the world around me turn into this green wonderland.

Fast forward to now. I'm living in Abu Dhabi, and while summer has finally chilled out a bit, the landscape here is still all shades of yellow and beige. 

Nothing wrong with this place - it's just that my eyes aren't used to this kind of scenery. 
It's altogerther a different biome that doesn't inspire me much.

There's this park next to my building with a green lawn, some ghaf trees, and date palms. 
The trees are cool - they belong here naturally.

But that lawn? It feels so artificial. 
It reminds me of the grass back home where I used to play, but something's off. Maybe it's those sprinklers constantly running to keep it alive in this desert heat.

So when I went back to Kerala recently, I decided to do something about it. 
I brought back a piece of home with me.

Literally.

I have two small money plants from my mom's garden sitting on my desk right now. 
Ironically they are planted in two coke bottles, ironically.

These little green guys make my day so much better.
Every time I look at them, I'm reminded of home and all those monsoon memories.

It's funny how sometimes the colors you need aren't the ones surrounding you, but the ones you have to carry with you from the places that made you who you are.


### A Piece of Home

While I was little late to write this month's topic, I was quite interested when I came to know about this month's topic, Colors(i'm used to writing it Colours, but i will stick with colors for now).

I'm born and raised in India, also spent majoruty of my life there, so colors is a topic close to heart. I bet everyone who thinks about India has this idea of vibrant colors of india.

A little bit of backstory, I come from a palce called Kerala, a coastal state in south india sandwiched between arabian sea the west and the great western ghats on the east. It's a tropical heaven, and is often called Gods Own country even though it's a marketing thing by the tourism department.

For me the default thought or the color I resonate most is the lush green of my home. The green that appears when the torrential monsoon hits the coast of Kerala, turning everything into green in a matter of days.

All my childhood favourite childhood memories are walking around in rain, feeling the rain, watching the nature around me turn lush green..

I live now at the time of writing this in Abu Dhabi, just when summer has mellowed down, but the landscape still looks bleakm with shades of yellow,..

And trust me, this color, is not refreshing to my eyes. Nothing wrong with the place, just a biome im not used to..

There is a park next to me, with a green lawn and some gaff trees and somed ate palms. While the gaff and palms are natural to the habitat, the lawn feels odd. While it reminds me of the spongy green pastures i grew up running and playing, somethings not right, may be the constant sprinklers running to keep them alive..

So this time when i went home, I decided to bring a piece of home with me.

A peice of home with me, a piece of green from my garden, from my mom's garden.

I have 2 small money plants from home, here on my desk, ironically in a coke bottle.

This lush green makes my day, it's a piece of home..
