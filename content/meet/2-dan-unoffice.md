**Met online on 08-10-2024 at 21:00 GST**

Ben found out about me through the nownownow directory and reached out because I also live in the UAE now. It was a small and interesting discussion on random topics. We talked about how the UAE is overall safe, accommodating, and tax-free. He stays in Dubai, where I used to live before moving to Abu Dhabi. I told him about Abu Dhabi and how it's different from Dubai. The UAE has a hyper-delivery service called Careem, where you can order food and groceries. Ben was surprised by how fast they deliver. I told him about the situation in India, where hyper-delivery startups are very popular, with services like Blinkit delivering in a matter of minutes. I also mentioned how advanced payments in India are, especially with UPI. He told me about Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which he is practicing, and how it is quite popular in Dubai.
