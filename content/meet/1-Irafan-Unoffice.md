**Met online on 2024-10-01 at 21:00 GST**

This was my first official [Unoffice Hours](/unoffice-hours/). I'm glad people take the time to navigate my blog and book slots! Irfan found out about me through a common blogging WhatsApp group and was nice enough to point out some errors on my site, which I later corrected.

Irfan is a digital marketer from Mahe, India. We talked about digital marketing in general and his past projects. He is trying to become a specialist in LinkedIn and WhatsApp digital marketing.

During the Covid-19 lockdown, there was a huge surge of home bakers in Kerala. During that time, he ran an online WhatsApp-based cake booking service in his locality.

He also loves Notion and wants to become a specialist in that as well. He is very interested in making websites using Notion and believes it has true potential. I counter-argued the longevity of the platform and my bias towards Obsidian since it uses plain markdown and the format is platform-agnostic.

He is looking for interesting opportunities, full-time or as a freelancer!
