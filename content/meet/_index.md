These are some interesting conversations I've had with readers of this blog. I usually meet people who are in the same city as me, and virtually, I've opened up my calendar twice a week as part of my **[Unoffice Hours](/unoffice-hours)**. I'm currently in {{< currentlocation >}}, so if you're nearby, [reach out to me.](/contact)
