**Met online on 15-07-2025 at 21:00 GST**

Romir is the founder of [Hikoflow](https://hikaflow.com/), an AI-powered assistant for coding teams. He showed me a demo of the product and asked for the feedback. Felt like an interesting product, but I suggested I give more feedback after testing it myself. We also discussed about on what AI models he use, prompt injections and vulnerabilities within vibe coding. The most interesting part of the story was that he found me via ChatGPT! Looks like the [llms.txt](/llms.txt) works!
