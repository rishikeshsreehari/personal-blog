### üèã My Workout Regime

I'm currently focused on transforming my body and reducing my body fat to below 25%. This involves a lot of protein and long walks to ensure I'm in a calorie deficit while building muscle and losing fat.

I'm now doing strength training 3x a week, following [Greg Nuckol's beginner program](https://www.boostcamp.app/coaches/greg-nuckols/greg-nuckols-beginner-program) on Boostcamp. On gym days, I try to walk 5km and on other days I try to do light jogs. [My ankle](/journal/ankle-sprain/) is feeling better, and the doctor has given the green light for short runs and squats with light weights. I still feel a bit uneasy with deep squats at the lower position. Need a bit more work on the stability part, few more rehab sessions to go. Can't wait to run freely!



##### For my latest fitness updates, read my [fitness log](/fitness-log). It's interesting, I promise.
