### üí≠ What‚Äôs on My Mind?

Having lots of fun biking around the city! I'm so grateful for this nice weather and this great city!

In terms of a life update, I‚Äôve finally decided to get a driving license here. The feeling is a bit scary since the failure rates in the UAE are very high. I‚Äôm going for the Golden Chance opportunity, where I directly take a road test‚Äîbut I only get one 'Golden' chance!

I‚Äôm also trying to learn Arabic! I shall write about my plan soon!

- [Shark Tank India Season 4](https://www.serializd.com/show/Shark-Tank-India-153870/season/435209/4) - I don't like the editing or the judges. Just watching to see what Indian businesses are up to!

### üèã My Fitness


I'm currently focused on transforming my body and reducing my body fat to below 25%. This involves a lot of protein and long walks to ensure I'm in a calorie deficit while building muscle and losing fat.

I'm now doing strength training 3x a week, following [Greg Nuckol's beginner program](https://www.boostcamp.app/coaches/greg-nuckols/greg-nuckols-beginner-program) on Boostcamp. On gym days I try to go for a walk in the evenings. Other days, I try to alternate between cycling and light jogging.
