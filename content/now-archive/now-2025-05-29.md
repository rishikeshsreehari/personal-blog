### 🏋 My Fitness

I'm currently focused on transforming my body and reducing my body fat to below 25%. This involves a lot of protein and long walks to ensure I'm in a calorie deficit while building muscle and losing fat.

I've gone with a personal trainer since I felt that I'm not pushing myself enough! I go to the gym four days a week. I try to walk 5 km on gym days and bike a bit on Wednesdays and weekends! I'm following a sort of Push-Pull-Legs split since that is what my trainer is confident with. So it's chest and triceps on Monday, back and biceps on Tuesday, legs on Thursday, and finishing the week with shoulders and weakmuscles --  chest, biceps, and core on Friday. Feeling stronger, but not much fat loss has happened, to be honest!
