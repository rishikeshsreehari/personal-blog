### 💭 What’s on My Mind?  


Most of my time now is spent working on [TrackMonk](https://trackmonk.app). If you're someone who is interested or has tried calorie tracking I would love to speak to you. So kindly reach out!

Also, my latest obsession is Pakistani food, obsessed with the Payas and the oily food. Not the best for weight loss, but so yumm!

It's peak summer, and cannot wait for Winter! Started my driving lessons and hopefully if everything goes well, I'll have better mobility this winter!

### 🏋 My Fitness

It's peak summer, so walks have reduced. My weekly workout looks like Push, Pull, Legs & Upper + Core followed by 30-min incline treadmill walk on gym days. I try to cycle 2x a week, but can't wait for winter.
