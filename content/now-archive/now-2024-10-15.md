### My Workout Regime

I'm currently focusing on transforming my body and bringing my body fat down to below 25%. That means a lot of protein and long walks to ensure that I'm in a calorie deficit while gaining muscle and losing fat. These days, I work out four days a week at the gym following Trainer Winny's [beginner plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9ENCvFf9yQ). It's mainly a mix of compound exercises like bench press, overhead press, barbell row, squat, and deadlift. I'm nursing an ankle sprain, so squats and running are out of the equation, at least for a couple of weeks. Summer is officially over, and the weather is getting nicer day by day. I'm itching to run, but I guess I'll have to wait and focus on rehab.
