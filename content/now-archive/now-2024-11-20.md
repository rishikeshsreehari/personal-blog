### ✈️ Going Home!

I'll be in India from 23rd November to 16th December. My current plan is Mumbai → Nagpur → Chennai → Kochi. I'm excited to visit Mumbai to meet a friend after a long time, try some yummy street food, attend a friend's wedding in Nagpur, reconnect with family in Chennai, and spend time at home. We'll also take a short trip to my wife's ancestral house in Tanjavur! Super excited!

If you're based in any of these cities, feel free to [reach out](/contact)!

### 🏋 My Workout Regime

I'm currently focused on transforming my body and reducing my body fat to below 25%. This involves a lot of protein and long walks to ensure I'm in a calorie deficit while building muscle and losing fat.

I'm now doing strength training 3x a week, following [Greg Nuckol's beginner program](https://www.boostcamp.app/coaches/greg-nuckols/greg-nuckols-beginner-program) on Boostcamp. On gym days, I try to walk 5km and on other days I try to do light jogs. [My ankle](/journal/ankle-sprain/) is feeling better, and the doctor has given the green light for short runs and squats with light weights. I still feel a bit uneasy with deep squats at the lower position. Need a bit more work on the stability part, few more rehab sessions to go. Can't wait to run freely!
