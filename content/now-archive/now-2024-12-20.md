### 💭 What’s on My Mind?

The weather is very good here in Abu Dhabi now—it's the best time for some sightseeing. I'm excited about visiting a few art galleries and museums. One big goal I have now is to get my driving license here in Abu Dhabi. It's a challenge, but exciting times lie ahead!

### 🏋 My Fitness

Travel is finally over, winter is here, and my bike is with me. Excited to get back in shape!

<!--  

I'm currently focused on transforming my body and reducing my body fat to below 25%. This involves a lot of protein and long walks to ensure I'm in a calorie deficit while building muscle and losing fat.

I'm now doing strength training 3x a week, following [Greg Nuckol's beginner program](https://www.boostcamp.app/coaches/greg-nuckols/greg-nuckols-beginner-program) on Boostcamp. On gym days, I try to walk 5km and on other days I try to do light jogs. [My ankle](/journal/ankle-sprain/) is feeling better, and the doctor has given the green light for short runs and squats with light weights. I still feel a bit uneasy with deep squats at the lower position. Need a bit more work on the stability part, few more rehab sessions to go. Can't wait to run freely!

##### For my latest fitness updates, read my [fitness log](/fitness-log). It's interesting, I promise.
