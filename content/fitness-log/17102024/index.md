Woke up bit wonky after a not-so good sleep. Had a carb heavy meal so decided to skip breakfast.

Green tea, banana and off to gym.

Decent day at the gym. My form on deadlifts is still wobbly due to the ankle sprain. I could have gone for 65 kg on the last set but decided not to push my body too much. Calf strength is building up—I could easily do 20 reps each set. I'm still not ready to do weighted calf raises or seated calf raises due to the [ankle pain rehab](https://rishikeshs.com/journal/ankle-sprain/). As always, the preacher curl machine in this gym destroys my biceps. Uff!

Came home and had a protein shake with creatine. The [Dymatize Protein](https://geni.us/rs-dymatize) is very sweet, too sweet for my liking, to be honest. I'm not sure how creatine works, but I can feel that my strength has increased ever since I started taking it. Whether it's a placebo effect or an overall improvement of the mind-body connection is something to investigate.


Lunch was simple:


- 100g of sauteed chicken breast with tomato
- 100g of black chickpea stir fry(കടല മെഴുക്കുപുരട്ടി)
- 120g of boiled rice
- 150g of yogurt with 15g honey

Had an apple as an evening snack. Wifey came with some Aloo Bhujia and Kinder Bueno. Couldn't resist the urge.

Went for a walk afterward—a [solid walk](https://www.strava.com/activities/12679219006) of approximately 6 km.

Came back and had dinner, but went a bit overboard with the rice:

- 250g of white rice
- 100g of chicken
- 150g of black chickpea stir fry(കടല മെഴുക്കുപുരട്ടി)
- 50g of potato stir fry (ഉരുളക്കിഴങ്ങ് മെഴുക്കുപുരട്ടി)
- 50g of dal curry
- 1 Kitkat finger
- 1 Orange

### Stats for the day

Not a good day in terms of diet. I went overboard as I should ideally stay under 1700 Cal. I need to be more disciplined.
