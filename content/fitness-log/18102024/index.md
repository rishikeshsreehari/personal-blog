**18-10-2024, Abu Dhabi(UAE)**

Slept just 5 hours yesterday and woke up early with a headache. Coudln't sleep more as I had an appointment for my 4th physiotherapy session for my [anke sprain](journal/ankle-sprain/). 

Had just a green tea and went for the the session. On my way-back walked [barefoot](/journal/barefoot) in the nearby park and felt amazing. On the bus I randomly watched a short vide and it triggered a huge craving for porotta for breakfast. Went to the nearby restaurant and had 2 porottas and a beef curry for breakfast. Porotta has loads of calories so regretted it immediately.

Decided to skip lunch due to the carb heavy breakfast. Had 2 cups of coffee and a banana as evening snack. Was feeling a bit hungry so had my protein shake with almonds and brazil nut.

Not a good day in terms of diet. I went overboard as I should ideally stay under 1700 Cal. I need to be more disciplined.
