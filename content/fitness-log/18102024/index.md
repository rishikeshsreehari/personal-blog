Slept just 5 hours yesterday and woke up early with a headache. Couldn't sleep more as I had an appointment for my 4th physiotherapy session for my [ankle sprain](/journal/ankle-sprain/).

Had just a green tea and went for the session. On my way back, I walked [barefoot](/journal/barefoot-walking/) in the nearby park and it felt amazing. On the bus, I randomly watched a short video and it triggered a huge craving for porotta for breakfast. Went to the nearby restaurant and had 2 porottas and a beef curry for breakfast. Porotta has loads of calories, so I regretted it immediately.

Decided to skip lunch due to the carb-heavy breakfast. Had 2 cups of coffee and a banana as an evening snack. Was feeling a bit hungry, so I had my protein shake.

My wife decided to order some [chaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaat) (Indian savoury snacks!), so I had a few bites of samosa chaat, vada pav, and 2 pani puris.

Dinner was simple:

- 150g of baked chicken
- 150g of baked carrots with garlic
- 1 orange

Post-dinner, I went for a [6km walk](https://www.strava.com/activities/12687441136).

As per my goals, I need to limit my calorie intake to somewhere around 1800 calories, and today I failed again. The biggest culprit was the heavy breakfast in the morning, which ruined everything. I was craving some yogurt after my walk, but I couldn't have it since I was already in a calorie surplus.
