With yesterday's carb- and fat-heavy dinner, I decided to skip breakfast and go to the gym on an empty stomach. Had a decent session, but the lack of food and energy was clearly visible in my sets, especially toward the end, as I couldn't push much in the core and bicep workouts.

I was super hungry on the way back, so I grabbed a [Chicken Mandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandi_(food)) from a local restaurant. Ended up having 250g of chicken with some mandi rice. Had 2 leftover kaju katlis from yesterday and then went for a nap.

Woke up feeling quite energetic and decided to go for a [5.4 km walk](https://www.strava.com/activities/12751025045). I wasn’t in the mood for cooking, so I grabbed some grilled chicken for dinner. Had the grilled chicken with some hummus and garlic mayo. My wife had ordered some pani puri, so I had a few for fun.

Overall, it was a decent day in terms of workout, but there was a lot of chicken and protein. It wasn’t intentional, but hopefully, it will balance out yesterday's deficit. I’m not really sure about the science, but I guess too much protein in a meal might be expelled by the body without being fully utilized, or maybe even converted to fat!
