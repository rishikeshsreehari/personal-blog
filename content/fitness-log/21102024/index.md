Woke up pretty hungover and had no energy to go to the gym or work. Regretted with every cell in my body why I took the initiative to drink on a Sunday night and start the week so low. Had some tea, then 2 egg whites and 2 whole eggs boiled with some mayonnaise for breakfast. Took a shower after ruminating on the couch for a while and felt better.

Had some leftover rice from yesterday and ate it along with some beef fry and fish curry. Finished lunch with some yogurt and honey.

Had a couple of meetings, so couldnâ€™t go for a walk but decided to eat healthy for dinner. Pan-grilled some chicken strips with tomato and had it with the leftover rice from yesterday. Opened the fridge and found half a Kinder Bueno and ate it without any hesitation. Had some blackberries post-lunch and two spoons of samosa chaat my wife ordered.

Overall in a calorie deficit today, but mood was quite low due to the hangover and no movement at all. Slept late thanks to a late coffee, with a hope that tomorrow will be better.
