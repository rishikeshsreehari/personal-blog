Thanks to [yesterday's movie](/watch/meiyazhagan/), I woke up pretty late. Decided to skip breakfast and have a banana instead. Had some work to do, so went for a chicken shawarma downstairs. Apparently, they put only 90g of chicken in the shawarma. Too little, ain't it?

No evening snacks, and dinner was simple: some rice, some pan-seared chicken breast, leftover spinach from yesterday, and dal curry. Post-dinner, had 2 oranges and went for a [5km walk](https://www.strava.com/activities/12767197025).

Overall, very few calories, so felt decent considering I did some movement.
