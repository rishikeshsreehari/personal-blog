Woke up feeling better than yesterday but had only 5.5 hours of sleep. Had to eventually wake up because I had an appointment with the physiotherapist for my [ankle sprain](/journal/ankle-sprain/). Quickly ate 2 egg whites and whole boiled eggs and went for the session. Returned, had a coffee for energy and also a banana before the gym session. Felt good after hitting the gym in a while.

Decent session with some improvements in bench press. My left wrist is aching, probably due to a strain from a poor grip. I need to improve on that, particularly on the flat bench press. Overhead press is stagnant as usual, but I think it takes time. I can see definite progress in both knee raises and calf raises. Leg extension, as always, is progressing. I'm missing squats, but that has to wait considering the ankle injury.

Came back, had no time to cook as a few meetings were lined up, so picked up a chicken shawarma from [Uncle Shawerma](https://www.uncleshawerma.com/menu). Topped it with some yogurt and honey. Had a [protein shake](https://www.uncleshawerma.com/menu) in the evening along with 5 almonds and a Brazil nut. Dinner consisted of 150g of rice, 200g of leftover chicken from yesterday, 100g of cauliflower stir-fry, and some oranges.

Post dinner, went for a short [5km walk](https://www.strava.com/activities/12719889792), listening to a video explaining [parallel worlds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7yf33kewIM).

An uneventful day, but quite decent considering the last couple of days. Protein intake is showing a bit on the higher side, probably due to the miscalculation from the 300g shawarma at lunch. Wrist still hurts, can't rotate it much, let's see if I can do pull-ups and deadlifts tomorrow.
