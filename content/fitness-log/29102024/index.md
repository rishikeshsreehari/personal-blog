**29-10-2024, Abu Dhabi(UAE)**

Had to wake up early because I had an appointment with the physio. Normal scenes there, and on the way back, decided to walk barefoot in the park. It was very ironic to see a palm tree in a green pasture!

No breakfast and decided to hit the gym directly!

I was still feeling some pain and uneasiness in the wrist joint, especially while twisting. So I was careful while doing bench press. All the grip videos on YouTube, they are not really helping me. I feel quite weird lifting with my knuckles facing the ceiling. Maybe I’ve been lifting wrong all this while. Over to the overhead press and, geez, I realized I didn’t mess up my wrist while doing bench press, but overhead press was the culprit. Couldn’t risk it further, so I decided to go for lateral raises. Did some leg press instead of leg extensions today and was out of the gym quickly.

On the way back, grabbed some king fish fry as protein for lunch along with some leftover rice, spinach, and some gravy. No evening snack, and dinner was chapathi, chicken breast, and some black gram stir fry.

Had a protein shake before bed and off to sleep.
