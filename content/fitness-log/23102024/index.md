Woke up very late since I slept late at 3 AM. Decided again to skip breakfast and go directly for lunch. Gym session was not possible as expected due to the sore wrist. Made some ground beef with eggs, had it with chapatis along with yesterday's dal curry and cauliflower stir-fry. Ended up eating the whole ground beef, which was approximately 200g cooked!

Rest of the day was mostly busy with lots of work and was sedentary most of the day. Had 5 almonds and a Brazil nut as a snack in the evening. Skipped the shake since lunch was protein-heavy.

Dinner was some quick stir-fried chicken cubes with a chapati and some dal. Had a few oranges post-dinner for something sweet and the day was almost over. Was feeling a bit hungry later, so I had a protein shake to end the day.

A super sedentary day I regret, but decided not to go for a walk late at night and start fresh tomorrow.
