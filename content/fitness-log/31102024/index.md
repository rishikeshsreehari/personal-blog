Woke up and decided to skip breakfast and head to the gym. It was a bad decision as I felt quite tired, especially once I started the deadlift session. Lesson learned: unless I'm going to the gym before 11 AM, never skip breakfast. I decided to get a quick energy boost and grabbed an oat drink from the gym's shop. That turned out to be a mistake—I didn’t check the price and ended up paying 15 AED for a 250ml pack of oat shake. That's a lot for the UAE, considering a can of Coke is just 2.5 AED and a 30g protein drink is 7 AED. It’s even double the price of the same drink in the UK! Felt like I got scammed.

Low energy and motivation made for a poor gym session, likely due to the lack of breakfast. By the time I got to calf and ab workouts, I was really struggling. Left the gym and somehow craved a Kerala meal for lunch. When I got there, they had run out, and only mutton biryani was available. Ended up eating a subpar mutton biryani! Came home, did some work, and had a protein shake as an evening snack.

It was Diwali eve, so my wife suggested we go to the city for some shopping. Went there but couldn’t find any clothes we liked, so we didn’t buy anything. Found a cute stall selling fried potatoes, so we ordered a medium portion. When we were in Dubai, Kamath restaurant was one of my wife’s favorites, so we decided to go there. The waiter messed up our order—apparently, it was his first day. We thought we were ordering something spicy as he suggested, but it turned out to be sweet. Luckily, a senior waiter stepped in before the order was placed, and we switched to safe options: burnt garlic fried rice, gobi manchurian as mains, and paneer hariyali tikka as a starter. The food was a disaster—probably the worst manchurian we’ve had. My wife is finding it hard to get good vegetarian food in Abu Dhabi. Felt upset, came home, had some oranges to relieve the uneasiness, and went to bed.

Overall, lots of carbs today, but not enough protein! It’s hard to meet the protein requirement, especially when having vegetarian food!
