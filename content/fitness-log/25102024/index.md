Skipped breakfast and worked all morning. Decided to go straight for lunch with yesterday's beef, gobi manchurian, and cauliflower leftovers. Had that and worked for the rest of the evening.

Since it was Friday, my wife decided we should go for a South Indian vegetarian dinner at Sangeetha's. The thing is, I don't hate vegetarian food, but the fact is it's just full of carbs, which isn’t ideal with my current fitness goals. Nevertheless, I decided to go for it.

Had a podi masala dosa along with a portion of kothu porotta. [Dosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa_(food)
) is a savory crepe made with fermented batter, and podi masala dosa is filled with mashed potatoes in masala, sprinkled with a spice blend. [Porotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotta) is a South Indian flatbread made with refined flour, which is not very healthy. Kothu porotta is essentially a stir-fry of porotta with some veggies. A friend joined us for dinner, and on the way back, somehow the waiter convinced me to purchase some sweets ([kaju katli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaju_katli)).

Talked with my friend for a while and decided to [walk 4.5 km](https://www.strava.com/activities/12744141092) back home to burn off some of those calories. Surprisingly, by the end of the day, I was still hungry and still at a calorie deficit. I highly doubt this since tracking calories for complex Indian food is a tricky affair.
