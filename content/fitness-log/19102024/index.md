Had a decent night of sleep and relaxed all morning. Decided to skip breakfast and go directly for lunch. Wife made some noodles with scrambled eggs and then went for a nap.

Woke up super hungry and decided to have yesterday's leftover chicken. Ended up eating 300g of chicken :)

Wife was craving some chaat, and we decided to go to a place called Chaat Junction with a lot of people hyping it up. Turned out to be just okay. Had some pav bhaji, 2 pani puris, and half a vada pav. Somehow, the waiter convinced me to order a custard apple cream dessert. Had a few spoons of it and packed it.

Decided to go to Corniche Beach to get some steps in and also burn off the carb-heavy dinner we just had. Ironically, we ended up having ice cream from ColdStone. Did a [short walk of 4km](https://www.strava.com/activities/12695394881), came back, had a few spoons of the dessert, and off to sleep.

I was supposed to go to the gym today but somehow convinced myself to skip it and just relax. Not much regret, but yeah, lots of carbs. Also, I feel these calories bit off, especially for Indian food.
