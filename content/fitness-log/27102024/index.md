Woke up late and skipped breakfast as usual! Since yesterday was quite chicken-heavy, I decided to go for veggies for lunch. Had some rice with 3 boiled eggs, cauliflower stir-fry, and spinach stir-fry. After lunch, I mostly rested and had a few almonds and a Brazil nut for an evening snack.

I was craving something meaty and found a good deal on a rib-eye steak. It arrived within 10 minutes, thanks to hyper-delivery services these days. Iâ€™m no steak expert, but I feel I did a decent job considering my non-stick pan. Had the steak with some leftover rice and a fried egg.

Decided to [watch a movie](/watch/meiyazhagan/) with my wife and ended up snacking on some Lays and half a can of Coke. Ended the day with a protein shake, regretting a day spent entirely on the couch.
