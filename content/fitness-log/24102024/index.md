Woke up a bit early; my wrist was still a mess, so I decided to skip the gym. Had the usual breakfast: 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites with some mayonnaise. Lunch was chapathi, pan-seared chicken breast, and gobi masala.

For an evening snack, I had some almonds, Brazil nuts, and a mandarin. For dinner, my wife decided to order from a Kerala restaurant that I like a lot. The thing with Kerala restaurants is that the veg food can be hit or miss. My beef tawa masala was delicious, but her gobi manchurian was a disaster—peppery with a weird sauce flavor. She didn’t even touch it, so I had to eat a portion of it. Ended up having a can of Coke and a KitKat. I think I really have a sweet tooth.

With all the gobi manchurian guilt in me, I went for a [7.3 km walk](https://www.strava.com/activities/12736620253). Had a protein shake before bed, then off to sleep.
