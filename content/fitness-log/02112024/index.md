Had an early meeting, so I woke up early and had the usual breakfast of boiled eggs with mayo. Slept only for a few hours, so took an early morning nap. Wife made some [Puliyodharai](https://www.kannammacooks.com/puliyodharai-iyengar-puliyodharai-kovil-puliyodharai/) (South Indian style tamarind rice), some beef fry, potato, and yogurt.

Took a nap again since I had a concert to attend by [AR Rahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._R._Rahman)! Had a protein shake in the evening and then headed to the concert. Had a few beers at the concert and came back home super hungry. It was too late to order anything, so went for the default grilled chicken with hummus from a nearby place.

Overall, the day was fun, but very little movement and a lot of calories (loads of protein as well)!
