**20-10-2024, Abu Dhabi(UAE)**

Woke up late, chilled around, and decided to skip breakfast again considering how carb-heavy yesterday's dinner was. Did some cleaning, got a head massage from my wife, and took a nice bath. Decided to order lunch and ended up ordering beef fry and something called 'Uruliyiloottu.' I've never had this dish in Kerala, but I think it's some sort of invention by the Kerala restaurants in the Middle East. It's basically rice mixed with spicy fish gravy, with some beef roast, chicken roast, and fish fry on the side. Since there was an offer, I ordered an extra beef fry as well. The portions were too big, so I ate some and kept the rest for later.

Took a nap and chilled all evening. Somehow, an impromptu plan came up, and we decided to go out drinking on a Sunday night as there was happy hour until 10 PM. Reached there at 9 PM and realized that they changed the offer, and happy hour was only until 8 PM. I had a pint of Stella and Hoegaarden. Had lots of complimentary peanuts and a portion of breaded jalapeños which tasted more like bread than jalapeños. Had a good time, and on my way back, I talked to the manager about the whole happy hour thing. He offered us a complimentary pint each as a token of compensation. Third pint of the day, and I could really feel that I'm getting old. Before I could tell, he poured me Hoegaarden when I wanted to have BrewDog's Punk IPA. Next time!

Came home almost wasted, drank lots of water. Was feeling hungry after a while and had a small portion of leftover rice and the beef fry.

A not-so-good day in terms of health. I will regret this tomorrow.
