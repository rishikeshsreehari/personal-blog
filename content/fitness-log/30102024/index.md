Woke up and had breakfast for the first time in a long time. The usual: 2 whole boiled eggs and 2 boiled egg whites with some garlic mayo for flavor. Had some pending work, so went straight into it. Got on a call with a friend and caught up on a lot of things, but it lasted long, and I had a very late lunch at 3:30 PM. Lunch was some chapathi, some dal curry, 100g of pan-seared chicken breast, and some yogurt.

Back to work mode with a lot of pending tasks since it was [newsletter](https://newsletter.rishikeshs.com/p/77-cocktails-clothesline-animals) publishing day as well. Had a banana for an evening snack and ordered charcoal chicken from outside. The portions were hugeâ€”280g of grilled chicken, 60g of hummus, and some garlic mayo.

Published the newsletter and slept peacefully, skipping the protein shake as I was quite dormant and had already hit my protein intake. I need to ensure that I get some movement on days like these!
