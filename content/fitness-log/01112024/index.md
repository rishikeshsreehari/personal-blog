Woke up and had breakfast since I had my last scheduled physiotherapy session and a consultation with the doctor. Had the usual egg breakfast (2 egg whites, 2 whole eggs, and mayo). Went to see the doctor, who did some assessments. My ankle is healing, and he suggested another round of physiotherapy sessions. He also gave the green light for light jogs and squatting, which made me very happy. Since I have overpronation, it’s another reason for ankle stability issues. He suggested using shoe inserts, but they’re quite expensive and usually not covered by insurance. Anyway, we decided to apply for insurance and see how it goes.

Had my measurements taken, and it was quite late to cook lunch, so I had Kerala meals (rice, sambar, cabbage stir fry, fish fry, fish curry, and papadam) and a beef fry for lunch. Quite cheap—the whole meal cost less than [yesterday’s ridiculous](/fitness-log/15) protein drink. The beef fry wasn’t necessary, but my brain played its games, and I couldn’t resist. Came home, had some oranges, and started work.

Since the doctor suggested running, I decided to go for a short jog. [Ran for 2.2 km](https://www.strava.com/activities/12798763859); it felt amazing, but my legs felt tight overall, probably because I haven’t run in a long time. Decided to walk a bit and order dinner. [Walked for 5 km](https://www.strava.com/activities/12798763930) and ordered dinner from a nearby restaurant— the usual, grilled chicken, hummus, and bread.

Had dinner, spent some time with my wife, and went off to bed. Feeling amazing, probably due to the fact that I can run again. But I need to be careful!
