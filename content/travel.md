Like most of the humans on this planet, I love traveling. For a long time, I've thought of creating a travel blog, but it never happened and is not sustainable. This page sort of documents all my latest and past travels to an extent possible. Some of the old travels need updation, as this page is a work in progress. Idea is to pen down interesting thoughts on the country as a way to document my travels and add some interesting clicks from the nation.
