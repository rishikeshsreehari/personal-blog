I had my first physiotherapy session in my life. I wish I had taken care of my ankle more seriously. With winter around the corner, I now live in Abu Dhabi where winters are awesome. I can't wait to go out and run, cycle, or go for long walks. I hope my ankle heals fast. Although my plans of running a half marathon in November are almost shattered, I should at least be able to run short distances. 

My physiotherapist told me to stick to the RICE method, which is basically Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation for all injuries. I told him that I knew this but never did it. He laughed and replied that he himself didn't do this when he had an ankle sprain, and he'd had 5 sprains ever since. What a weird world!

The session was simple. He applied some weird gel on my ankle and massaged the area with an ultrasound gun which apparently heals. Then he attached some probes to the affected area and turned on a dial. It felt like ants moving around with a slight bit of pain. I wish I had known what it was so that I could Google more about it. I asked him, but his English was broken, so I didn't push it further. If I try hard enough, maybe I can find it on Google. My mind is already overloaded with all the information crap in the world which I shouldn't know, so I decided against it. Maybe when I go to bed, if I remember, I'll Google it.
