On my way back from the physiotherapist, I decided to walk home through a nearby park. After living in a concrete jungle for almost a year, it felt amazing to see and walk through greenery. While it was risky, I decided to walk barefoot through the grass. I noticed a few people looking at me — I mean, it's not a common sight in a city like Abu Dhabi to see someone walking barefoot in a park, holding their slides in hand. But who cares, it felt amazing. The sprinklers were on, and the grass was wet in a few spots, which made it even better. It brought back memories from my childhood, where we used to play barefoot and walk on the grass without a care in the world.

While I don’t agree or believe in all the tribalism around barefoot walking and the BS about grounding and such, I have to admit it felt amazing. Maybe it’s just the sensation of the earth directly under your feet. I think I'll do it again!

I've seen so many weirdos, especially Westerners, walking barefoot in the mountains, claiming the health benefits of barefoot walking. I mean, I agree that shoes can compress your toes and all, but walking barefoot in the mountains? That doesn’t make sense. There are many adverse health effects related to it. If you don’t believe me, [read what the experts say](https://time.com/6284245/walking-barefoot-health-risks/).

Long story short, it felt amazing, and I might do it again. But I need to be careful because I can’t afford another ankle sprain, especially with winter around the corner and the weather getting better.
