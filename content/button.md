This is a useless button. It absolutely does nothing useful. Seriously, don’t even think about clicking it. Your energy is precious, and clicking this button is a complete waste of it. If you click it, it just updates the click count, that’s all. Trust me, it’s not worth it. But hey, if you’re curious, go ahead and click!
