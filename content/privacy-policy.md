As a privacy freak myself, I try to be as transparent as possible.

Unless you entered your email on any of the forms or emailed me directly, I do not have any means to know who you are.

I use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) for analytics, a privacy-friendly, free, open-source alternative to Google Analytics. It does not use cookies and identifies unique visits without storing any personal data. All I see on my analytics dashboard is the browser information, location, screen size, and referring sites.

I use [Genius Links](https://geniuslink.com/blog/gdpr-geniuslink-you/) for localizing Amazon affiliate links on the site. But Genius is click-based and does not use any cookies to redirect to respective Amazon storefronts. Amazon, on the other hand, uses cookies, and these may stay up to 24 hours in your browser, letting affiliates earn some money without costing you anything. Read more about Amazon's privacy notice [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ#GUID-87E2CF41-74C0-4C0F-BD6A-7234DACA5919__SECTION_E982471ABC324538AAFE64B5F4E35AC3).

I've enabled analytics on my hosting provider CloudFlare, but this "does not use any client-side state, such as cookies or localStorage, to collect usage metrics. We also donâ€™t 'fingerprint' individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of displaying analytics." Read more about it [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).

If you have entered any forms on my page or emailed me directly, all your information is saved on Google. So you will have to refer to Google's respective policies for information on those.

The subscribe form on the [newsletter](/newsletter) page is an embedded iframe from Substack itself. Your email and other information are directly stored at Substack, and you can refer to their privacy policy [here](https://substack.com/privacy).

On some pages, for instance, the Substack subscribe iframe on the [newsletter](/newsletter) page and other pages that do not exist now but might in the future, those services may or may not collect data. For more information on those, please refer to the respective privacy policies.

This site contains links to other sites that are not operated by me. If you click a third-party link or service, you will be directed to and may use the third party's site or service. I strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.


For any more information on the privacy of this blog or if you have any suggestions, please do not hesitate to [contact](/contact) me. If you have commented or emailed me in the past and wish to delete your data, please send me an [email](mailto:hello@rishikeshs.com).
