My name is Rishikesh (pronounced as ri-shee-kay-sh ).   
Currently I live in {{< currentlocation >}} with my wife. 

I was born when there were  [358 ppm](https://www.co2levels.org) of carbon in the atmosphere  in a small village in Southern India, exactly at `9.754` latitude and `76.363` longitude, on a national strike day. I have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a postgraduate degree in Renewable Energy. While my [interests](/interests) evolve, my passion lies in doing as much as I can in solving the greatest threat faced by humanity i.e. climate change. I'm currently unemployed and looking for opportunities where I can contribute and grow further. I'm working on few [side projects](/projects), mostly trying to learn how to write, code, build, ship things. 

I love to run, ride, lift, travel, learn new things and more.

I have this sense of curiosity about this world and that drives me everyday. I'm so grateful to be alive this point of history where everyone with a access to internet and a computer, can literally learn anything in this world. I'm so excited about the sheer amount of things that are out there to discover and learn, and excited about the fact that it is an infinite game. I find the most joy when I discover something, learn more about it and figure out how it works. I thrive at those 'ahaa' moments where I understand how things work. 

`I'm fascinated by the nature of the world and what it means for how we should act within in it. This is my digital home where I share what I'm up to.


For a large period of my life, I struggled to become a specialist. Be it career, life or hobbies, I always had multiple passions and interests that evolve over time. While I know being a generalist is hard thing to be, especially in terms of career, I've always struggled resisting it. I've come to realize that being nicheless is not generally a bad thing and this blog is a reflection of that. 


I think of this website itself as an artwork, something that evolves over time. Like any other artist and art, this website is not an original. It's been inspired by numerous blogs and sites out there in the wild west corner of internet. But like an art piece, each and every inch of this website is crafted with clear vision, attention and reason. Read more about how this blog is built on the [colophon](/colophon) page or read my blog post titled ["My blog is my greatest art"].


To know more about my life, visit my [timeline](/timeline). [Lifestack](/lifestack) page has a list of things I use and to know what I'm upto, visit my [now](/now) page. If you are curious, [library](/library) has a list of books that I've read recently and [watch](/watch) page has list of movies/shows that I've seen recently.  This website is more or less built like a website with various interesting pages and easter eggs. Feel free to explore as you wish with no end goal.
