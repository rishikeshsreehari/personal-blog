Here's a list of things that I want to purchase sometime in the future, in the order of importance.


1. **A New Road Bike**: I'm eyeing on Scott's [Speedster 10](https://www.scott-sports.com/in/en/product/scott-speedster-10-bike) or Trek's [Domane SL5](https://www.trekbikes.com/in/en_IN/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/domane/domane-sl/domane-sl-5/p/28311/) as of now. It's an expensive purchase, but will probably buy it in next 2 years. Temporarily I might go for [Polygon's Strattos S2(https://www.polygonbikes.com/strattos-s2/)].

2. **Wahoo KICKR Core**: I really need to structure my cycling workouts and a smart indoor trainer like[ Wahoo's KICKR CORE](https://geni.us/rsh-wahoo-kickr-core) looks ideal paired with a ZWIFT subscription. 

3. **Coros Pace 2**: My current fitness tracker does the job, but has limited metrics. Would love to upgrade to a [Coros Pace 2](https://geni.us/rsh-coros-pace-2) sometime in the future!

4. **Wahoo ELEMNT ROAM**: I plan to couple of long cycling events like [PBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris%E2%80%93Brest%E2%80%93Paris) & [LEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%E2%80%93Edinburgh%E2%80%93London) in upcoming years and a bike computer like the [Wahoo ELEMNT ROAM](https://geni.us/rsh-coros-pace-2) is essential.

5. **Massage Gun**: The current massager I have, does the job, but is quite bulky and is difficult to target certain spots. I'll probably buy one of these [deep tissue massage guns](https://geni.us/rsh-beatxp-massager) sometime in the future.

6. **Macbook Air M2**: My current laptop is more than 6 years old and I would proably upgrade to a [Macbook Air M2](https://geni.us/rsh-macbook-air-m2) within a year or two.

7. **Airpods Pro 2**: My current headphones are fine, but integration with iPhone is not seamless. Would love to upgrade to [Airpods Pro](https://geni.us/rsh-airpods-pro2) alongwith the Mac. 

8. **Stryd**: My running form is not the best and I would love to get some more analytics with a [Stryd tracker](https://www.stryd.com/gl/en).
