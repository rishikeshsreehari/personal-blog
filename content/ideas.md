This is a public list of ideas that I would like to work on someday. This is a copy of the ideas note I have in my Obsidian vault, where I jot down interesting projects, concepts, and thoughts that I find intriguing and might want to explore in the future. Since it is not practically possible for anyone to work on every idea they have, I thought it would be better to make this note public so that someone else might build it someday.

Ideas that I'm currently working on are crossed out and have been moved to my [projects](/projects) page. Against each idea, I've added a short description to provide more context. If you are interested in any of the ideas mentioned below and want to work on them or collaborate with me, feel free to [contact](/contact) me. In case any of the ideas already exist, please let me know, and I will cross them out with a backlink to the project.




{{< accordion summary="A Search Engine for Personal Blogs" openByDefault=true >}}
I'm unable to search for content in personal blogs on google or any other search engine. Kagi small web is there, but it's not personal blog specific.

{{< accordion summary="Cricket Guard Line Projector" openByDefault=false >}}
If you watch cricket, you can see batsmen often marking guard lines against the stumps by asking the umpire. Why can't we have a laser projection of the stumps controlled by the umpire with a remote?

{{< accordion summary="A cheap running tracker" openByDefault=false >}}
There are multiple running trackers that you can attach to shoes, like [Stryd](https://www.stryd.com/gl/en?utm_source=rishikeshs.com), but these are quite expensive. Why is it so hard to make cheaper running trackers?

{{< accordion summary="A platform to read both sides of an argument." openByDefault=false >}}
A moderated platform where a dedicated page is present for popular topics, and people can read about both sides of the argument.

{{< accordion summary="Indian News Aggregator with relevance" openByDefault=false >}}
India is struggling with misinformation and rigged news. The magnitude is quite high, considering the huge population, the demographics, and the rising internet penetration. A platform like [News Minimalist](https://www.newsminimalist.com/) that removes clickbait titles and filters relevant news would be useful for India.

{{< accordion summary="Global Fish Database in different languages" openByDefault=false >}}
Fishnames are tricky if you travel around the world. Within a country itself, fish names would be different. A global database of fishnames in all different languages would be great!

{{< accordion summary="Bookmark for Videos & Podcasts" openByDefault=false >}}
I wish there was a tool to record a particular timestamp on a video or a podcast so that I can watch it from the saved timestamp when I resume, rather than scrolling and finding the time.

{{< accordion summary="Strava for Writers" openByDefault=false >}}
Strava is a great tool to track your activities. As a writer, such a tool would be great to see the number of words written every day and also get a sneak peek at others' writings.

{{< accordion summary="About Me Collection" openByDefault=false >}}
I love reading the About Me sections of various personal blogs. A curated list of the best about pages would be cool.

{{< accordion summary="~~Evergreen Hosting~~" openByDefault=false >}}
~~People put a lot of effort into their blogs, and most often, after the person passes away, these blogs go obsolete. How about a service that you can pay for one-time or in installments, ensuring that your blog stays live forever?~~

*Update: I wrote about in detail [here](/journal/evergreen-blogs). Also, checkout [Digital Legacy Trust](https://legacytrust.nz/) by Derek Sivers.*
