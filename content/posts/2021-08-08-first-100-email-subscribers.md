<p class="has-drop-cap">
  End of May 2021, I started a newsletter called <a href="https://rishikesh.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://rishikesh.substack.com/">10+1 Things</a> on Substack. The main idea behind the newsletter was to funnel some traffic to this blog and to other projects I&#8217;m working on. In fact, I came up with the name 10+1 Things in 15 mins and decided to start it on <a href="https://substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://substack.com/">Substack</a> as it was quick to start. As I&#8217;m writing this, 10+1 Things has just crossed 100+ subscribers. From being a small fun project, the newsletter has grown to a separate project and has become a part of my routine. All this happened in a span of 2 months and the newsletter is growing strong with a +50% open rate and an expected subscriber count of 300+ by end of 2021(I extrapolated the subscriber data!). I started at zero and haven&#8217;t spent any money on ads or promotions. All growth has been organic so far, thanks to some cross-promotion with other fellow writers in the community. Here&#8217;s what I learnt from growing my newsletter from 0 to 100 subs in 2 months:
</p>

## **Just Start!**<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default">

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="580" height="435" src="https://i0.wp.com/rishikeshs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Old-Logo.png?resize=580%2C435&#038;ssl=1" alt="newsletter-logo" class="wp-image-504" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/rishikeshs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Old-Logo.png?w=1024&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/rishikeshs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Old-Logo.png?resize=300%2C225&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/rishikeshs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Old-Logo.png?resize=768%2C576&ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <figcaption>I created the first logo using some random font from the internet!</figcaption></figure> 

I have always struggled to start. Being a person who cares a lot about design and aesthetics, I usually spend a crazy amount of time tweaking things to launch the perfect product. When I started 10+1 Things, I decided that I&#8217;m gonna start anyway irrespective of the design or clarity. If you check the initial few issues in the <a href="https://rishikesh.substack.com/archive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://rishikesh.substack.com/archive">archive</a>, you can see that the style was different and not uniform. All I wanted to do was start and write about 11 things every week. Things have changed a lot and now I have created a <a href="https://rishikesh.substack.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://rishikesh.substack.com/about">process to optimize the workflow</a>. But I think the reason this newsletter has reached so far is that I decided to just start and forget about tweaking small things.

## **Impostor Syndrome**

<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/imposter-syndrome-and-social-anxiety-disorder-4156469#:~:text=Impostor%20syndrome%20(IS)%20refers%20to,perfectionism%20and%20the%20social%20context." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.verywellmind.com/imposter-syndrome-and-social-anxiety-disorder-4156469#:~:text=Impostor%20syndrome%20(IS)%20refers%20to,perfectionism%20and%20the%20social%20context.">Impostor Syndrome</a> is _an internal experience of believing that you are not as competent as others perceive you to be_. I always had problems with Impostor syndrome and always had the fear of not being good enough. This was one reason which held me back to <a href="https://rishikeshs.com/5-reasons-why-i-decided-to-start-a-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="5 Reasons Why I Decided to Start a Blog">start blogging</a> or a <a href="https://rishikeshs.com/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Join 10+1 Things">newsletter</a>. Even though I overcame it by publishing the first edition, I was reluctant to share it with the public. I was worried that I won&#8217;t be good enough and I would eventually drop this eventually by not being consistent. Only after I published my 2nd edition, I started to share the newsletter with friends and with the public. One quote by <a href="https://sive.rs/obvious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://sive.rs/obvious">Derek Siver</a>&#8216;s on his book <a href="https://geni.us/rsh-anythingyouwant" rel="sponsored" title="https://geni.us/rsh-anythingyouwant">Anything you Want</a> has helped me a lot in this matter and it says: **&#8220;_Whatâ€™s obvious to you is amazing to others._&#8220;**. Also, the book [_Show Your Work_ by Austin Kleon][1] helped me a lot in overcoming this fear. To everyone who is reading this, my advice would be to just start and forget about others.

## **Community Matters**

When it comes to newsletters, community matters a lot. I was lucky enough to get good support from my close friends which encouraged me to continue this journey. Also, Substack has a great community of writers who unite every Thursday for <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/office-hours-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://on.substack.com/p/office-hours-10">Writer hours</a> helping each other. This feeling of community has benefitted me a lot. In terms of numbers, I have done 3-4 cross-promotions with other newsletter writers, which helped me to grow the subscriber base. I also have a close-knit group of newsletter creators whom I connect often for advice and support, and this has contributed a lot to this newsletter&#8217;s growth.

## **Developing a process**

Since <a href="https://rishikesh.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://rishikesh.substack.com/">10+1 Things</a> is a newsletter that features <a href="https://rishikeshs.com/curator-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Curator Economy: Why Human Curation matters">curated content</a>, it involves a lot of effort and time. Over time I have created a process that helps me to identify, collect and sort important snippets of information that I plan to be featured. Newsletter writing has become a part of my routine and it inspires me to read and learn throughout the week. Because of the routine, I&#8217;m more mindful of consuming information and weed out any unwanted distractions. I&#8217;m about to publish the 12th edition and because of the processes and systems I have created, I have reduced at least 30% of effort for writing every week. If you want to read more about the process I follow, I have written about it on the <a href="https://rishikesh.substack.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://rishikesh.substack.com/about">about page of my substack</a>. 

Are you a newsletter writer or do you want to start one? I would love to connect with you and discuss more.
