{{< dropcap >}} The idea of meditation has always confused me. Being an atheist ([This is my bible!](https://geni.us/rsh-origin-of-species)) as well as a rationalist, I thought of it as another woo-woo thing. [Woo-Woo](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/woo-woo) basically means "ideas or methods that are based on false beliefs or imaginary things, rather than reason or scientific knowledge." Earlier this year, I was backpacking through North India and I met many people who had life-changing experiences with meditation. I also saw multiple scams where westerners were lured into this whole spirituality trap in the name of meditation. {{< /dropcap >}}

I had struggled with a bit of anxiety and restlessness ever since I quit my job last year. I had received suggestions from many people to try meditation, but I was overly skeptical considering the scent of spirituality it had. Then I happened to read a [Twitter thread by Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481752448524289). [Naval][1] is someone I admire, and his ideas and philosophies resonate a lot with me. To be honest, **the only reason I tried meditation was that I read about it from someone like Naval** (I’m working on being more open to things).

Since I was new to meditation, I needed some starting point. I tried multiple apps like [Calm](https://www.calm.com/), [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), but nothing worked for me. I discovered an app called [Waking Up](https://wakingup.com/) by [Sam Harris](https://samharris.org/), after reading his book [Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion](https://geni.us/rsh-waking-up). Even though I have mixed thoughts about [new atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atheism) and the [ideas in his books](https://geni.us/rsh-sam-harris), I decided to give the app a try.


The plan was to try the 28-day introductory course in the app, along with 2 daily meditations for a total of 30 days, and then see how it goes. I started the challenge on the 15th of May 2021 and decided to scribble my thoughts every day in a journal. These 30 days were amazing for me and opened up new perspectives. I could see changes in my everyday life due to the 10–20 minutes I spent every day. I’m now comfortable doing my own style of meditation and defining my own process. At times, I use the daily meditation option in the Waking Up app, but most days it’s just me sitting quietly, listening to my mind. Meditation is now a part of my routine just like working out. Based on my experience, I have penned down my own conclusions and observations on meditation below:

## Meditation is not spiritual but fasting for the mind

As Naval has said, meditation is the art of doing nothing. It is simply switching off your mind. While meditating, you cut off the outside noise and focus just on yourself. You don’t need gurus, chakras, Buddhas, kundalinis, or anything bogus to meditate. It is good to have an app like Waking Up to get started, but if you have a strong desire to start, you can do it by focusing on yourself. The whole idea that meditation takes us into altered states of consciousness doesn’t make sense to me. I felt relaxed and calm after meditation, but that doesn’t mean anything spiritual. I feel the same trance when I’m involved in something I like. I felt the same while photographing dogs in the alleys of Varanasi or doing gardening at home. I feel the same when I go for a hike in nature and I’m lost in my own mind.

## Meditation is a skill

Just like any other skill you try to learn, meditation takes consistent practice. It’s more like exercising a muscle you’ve never worked out before. It takes time to calm your mind and do nothing. Doing a 60-minute meditation is easier than doing a 30-minute meditation because it takes some time to get rid of thoughts in your mind. Meditation is not something you do for a challenge or seasonally. It should be practiced for at least 30 minutes daily as part of your routine. Since it’s a skill, it’s better to start with guided meditation using an app or video. Once you feel comfortable, experiment with the process and define your own style of meditation.

## Being mindful

I have realized that I’m more mindful after starting meditation. I have these self-pause moments throughout the day before speaking or analyzing things. I often think about why I’m doing a particular activity before starting it. I’ve started noticing the small things in my backyard, like the spider web behind my house or the moss patterns on the wall. Being mindful throughout the day has been the most positive impact meditation has had on me. I enjoy the small pauses of self-reflection and often wonder why I’m engaging in certain actions. In terms of photography, I believe I have a better eye now. I can see abstract patterns or stories I never noticed before in everyday life. In fact, recently I was thinking of doing a project on rust after seeing rust patterns on metal around my home.

## It’s all about you

There is no good or bad method. It’s not about reciting mantras or focusing on the breath. It’s a form of self-examination where you explore yourself while sitting quietly without disturbance. There’s no perfect style of meditation. It’s all about discovering what works for you. What I do is start by focusing on my breath and letting my mind wander and do nothing. I don’t resist or reject anything, I just let my mind choose the trail. I often feel grateful for the things I have in life during these sessions.

## The science

As per my research, there is no solid scientific proof of the benefits of meditation. There have been some studies with controlled groups showing positive results, but the results weren’t conclusive or better than existing treatments. I’m not in a position to comment on the science of meditation. For me, it’s more about calming myself and starting the day fresh. You can read more about the [science of meditation here](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients/). I also came across an article on [how mindfulness caused a nervous breakdown for a practicing meditator](https://danlawton.substack.com/p/when-buddhism-goes-bad).

## The journal

As I mentioned earlier, meditation is all about you. When I did the 30-day Meditation Challenge, I kept a small journal of my thoughts every day after meditating. These thoughts are random, don’t always make sense, and are never meant to be followed. Ignore all the advice on the internet about meditation, including this article. It’s all about you, and you have to discover it.

### Journal Entries

**#1:** Tried focusing on the visual field with closed eyes. Patterns were unique and realistic. At times, I got lost in thoughts but came back. I feel like I’m good at visualizing?

**#2:** Noticed thoughts. Traced them to their roots. Tried observing the visual field behind closed eyes.

**#3:** Tried to understand that the visual field, thoughts, and sensations all happen in consciousness. Tried to observe the subject that was looking. Explored the concept of where consciousness resides.

**#4:** Explored how I could improve the present moment. Realized my mind was restless and tried to understand the root cause of it.

**#5:** Breath concentration has become easier. I look forward to meditating every day. Still trying to find the root cause of thoughts.
