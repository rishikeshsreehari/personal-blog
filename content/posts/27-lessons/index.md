{{< dropcap >}} When I turned 27 this year, during a flight journey I thought of scribbling down 27 lessons I’ve learned over the years. I’ve tried to keep these lessons as short as possible with maximum clarity. {{< /dropcap >}}

1. [JOMO > FOMO](https://www.wholelifechallenge.com/fomo-vs-jomo-how-to-embrace-the-joy-of-missing-out/). Embracing the Joy of Missing Out (JOMO) over Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is the key to happiness and fulfillment over time.
2. Organic Farming might sound sustainable and fancy, but [it is not practical to use it to feed the rising population](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/world/asia/sri-lanka-organic-farming-fertilizer.html). Also, [it is quite unsustainable](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/10/22/organic-food-better-environment/) considering the amount of land it uses.
3. Learning doesn’t end in school and is a lifelong process. [Self-learning is key in the 21st century](https://medium.com/wondr-blog/self-learning-why-its-essential-for-us-in-the-21st-century-9e9729abc4b8).
4. Programming or coding is an essential skill to learn. I regret not learning it earlier, but I’m in the process of mastering it.
5. Excel is the most wonderful software in the world. I underestimated it until 2019, thinking it was just for accounting, but now I realize its incredible applications.
6. I never paid much attention to economics, but during my postgraduate studies, I fell in love with the subject, particularly after attending a lecture on the economics of renewable energy.
7. Statistics is not nonsense and is crucial for understanding trends and data analysis. I regret ignoring it, but I’m learning it now to shift toward a more data-oriented career.
8. Humans are wired to think linearly, so it’s hard for us to visualize exponential growth.
9. There is no secret formula for weight loss: Track your calories, and ensure calorie-in is always less than calorie-out. I lost 7 kg in 4 months by sticking to this.
10. It’s okay to change your belief systems over time. Successful people are those who question and adapt their beliefs often.
11. Reading is a skill that needs to be learned, and active reading is key for remembering and applying ideas.
12. No matter how great your ideas are, execution matters the most.
13. Never compare yourself to others. Would you really swap lives with the person you’re comparing yourself to?
14. There should be a purpose for every trip or journey. For me, learning something new from each place I visit is important.
15. Never overload food with spices. While Indian food is famous, sometimes the spices overpower the main ingredients.
16. People come and go in life, and death is inevitable. It’s not something to be overly concerned about.
17. Observe and learn from everyone, no matter how toxic they might be. Everyone has something to teach.
18. Limit your digital time, and start an [attention diet](https://rishikeshs.com/attention-diet/) to be more mindful of the information you consume.
19. Stop seeking inspiration all the time. Just because no one has done what you aim to do, doesn’t mean it can’t be done.
20. You’re not an impostor. Impostor syndrome is common, and everyone putting something out in public has felt it. [Learn to overcome it.][1]
21. Algorithms are designed to keep you addicted. Make sure you clear cookies, reset your search history, and prevent them from learning too much about you.
22. Never create art with an audience in mind. Create it for your own joy and pride. If it’s good enough, the audience will come.
23. Sugar is toxic to your body. In nature, we don’t have access to sugar at the levels we consume now. Our bodies aren’t designed for it.
24. If relationships turn toxic, let them go, no matter how close you are or were.
25. There’s a lot of misinformation and pseudoscience out there—whether it’s [hormone-free chicken](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/poultry-sector-clarifies-myths-around-consumption-of-broiler-chicken/article29095820.ece), [Ayurveda](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/amitabh-bachchan-india-coronavirus/615310/), or [MSG fears](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/20/why-americans-still-avoid-msg-even-though-its-health-effects-have-been-debunked/).
26. [You don’t have to follow the news](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli). Most of it is irrelevant. If you’re interested in a topic, follow an independent creator or writer via newsletter.
27. Exercising and being fit isn’t a seasonal task but a lifelong commitment. Build sustainable habits that last over time.
