<p class="has-drop-cap">
  I came to know about the concept of Resonance Journal when I watched Ali Abdaal&#8217;s video on how he uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYBB-Uw1IM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYBB-Uw1IM">notion for keeping his resonance calendar</a>. After watching the video, I felt like the term &#8216;Resonance Calendar&#8217; is not apt for what I wanted to do or achieve. I decided to rename it as &#8216;<a href="https://dent-radar-d40.notion.site/2615af7fb932434c9085b4c666781d20?v=089ad185b9354ae49ab8b26ef844a214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://dent-radar-d40.notion.site/2615af7fb932434c9085b4c666781d20?v=089ad185b9354ae49ab8b26ef844a214">Resonance Journal</a>&#8216; and set up one similar to Ali on Notion. I currently use the Resonance Journal as a tool in my journey towards self-discovery.

    Anytime I come across anything at all that resonates with me, I drop it into the Resonance Calendar on Notion. This lets me keep track of articles Iâ€™ve read, YouTube videos Iâ€™ve watched, books and podcasts Iâ€™ve listened to, and anything else I come across in life.

## How does it work?<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">

The concept is simple. Every time you come across a video, podcast, job, article, book, project, etc that resonates with you, add it as an entry to the resonance journal. Use the existing tags or create one if it doesn&#8217;t exist. Over time you would see a pattern or a common thread of things that resonates with you. You would eventually see that some items often resonate with you and have multiple entries in the journal. For example, I came across articles, blogs, personalities around human-centred Design a lot in my journal. It was really interesting as there were very few entries related to renewable energy, my major in the journal! ðŸ™‚

## Self-Discovery using Resonance Journal

I have always struggled with what I wanted to do in life. I have always wanted to work on something I&#8217;m really passionate about especially in terms of career as it occupies a major part of your life. Journaling about things that resonates with me had a positive effect on my self-discovery journey. I realized that things that I thought mattered to me or stuff that I thought fitted me are not the ones I have a true connection with. Through this process, I found interesting patterns and came across multiple personalities again and again in different contexts. In fact, at the time of writing this, I&#8217;m currently doing a program on Design Research by the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/invite?r=rishikesh-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored" title="https://www.interaction-design.org/invite?r=rishikesh-2">Interaction Design Foundation (IDF)</a>. This is something I have discovered after journaling for a few months on the resonance journal. I came across multiple instances where I felt a deep connection with design research like works by <a href="https://www.ideo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.ideo.com/">IDEO</a>, <a href="https://acumenacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://acumenacademy.org/">Acumen Academy</a>, <a href="https://space10.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://space10.com/">Space10</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman">Don Norman</a>, etc. Every time I read about something related to UX say design research or interaction design, I feel a true connection and I&#8217;m very excited to know more about it. The funny thing is these were the same things that made me excited 2 years back, and I thought of it as another curiosity craving. I don&#8217;t know where this is right or wrong, but I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;m pursuing something that resonates with me rather than doing something accidentally.
