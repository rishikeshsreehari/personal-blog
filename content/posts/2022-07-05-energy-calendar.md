  I prefer to have a schedule of things in my calendar so that I have an idea of what to focus on on a particular day. During weekends I try to plan my upcoming week in advance using Google Calendar. I&#8217;ve tried multiple calendar apps in the past, but have reverted back to Google Calendar as it is simple, free and syncs flawlessly across all my devices. I was looking at a way to track how I feel during the day and came across this method of colour-coding your calendar events by Sahil Bloom. He recently named it &#8216;<a href="https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1542867629047746561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Energy Calendar&#8217;</a>, a method with which you can colour code a particular event in your calendar according to how you feel. Looking at the colour patterns in your calendar, you can get a holistic view of your day and prioritize tasks that are less daunting.

## The Method

The framework or method is simple. Simply, colour code the events in your calendar at the end of the activity or day using the following or something similar:

  * üå≤Energizer: Energized me and made me think about it for hours
  * üîµEnergy Gainer: Created some energy.
  * ‚≠êÔ∏èNeutral: Not too great or too bad
  * üî∫Energy Drainer: Sucked the energy out of me<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

## How to Take Control of Your Time

  * At the end of the week, have a look a the past week&#8217;s events and reflect upon what all events drained your energy.
  * If two consecutive events are draining your energy, try to reorganize them. Revisit these events again next week.
  * Revaluate those events that are constantly sucking out your energy.
  * If any particular item in your calendar is not appearing too great, even though you expected it to be energizing, analyze what happened. Maybe the timing was not correct.
  * Be grateful for the energizing activities.
  * Strive to make your calendar fully green!

_Disclaimer: Even though this hack sounds fancy, I&#8217;ve discontinued this method as it adds a lot of friction to my process._
