Following the trend on the internet, I published [27 lessons](/27-lessons/) last year when I turned 27, which turned out to be quite popular and got featured in a few publications. As the last year progressed, I tried to scribble down some lessons I learned over the year. I turned 28 a couple of weeks ago, and here are some lessons I’ve learned over the years:
{{< /dropcap >}}

1. I’ve always thought that travel agents and tour packages sucked and were a scam. I learned it the hard way when I messed up my vacation with my partner to Armenia. If you’re short on time, have the budget, and want to enjoy your vacation without much hassle, go with travel agents.
2. Ask permission before touching or playing with other people’s pets. Pets are like family, and some pets, especially dogs, can be quite sensitive to strangers' presence.
3. I hate Instagram and hate the fact that it has made millions addicted to its reels and stories. Irrespective of my opinion, if you’re a business owner or a content creator, Instagram is the place to be to drive your conversions.
4. Tourism has become mainstream, and there is no way to avoid crowds. Accept the reality and move on, or try exploring places that are not accessible by roads.
5. To make better choices, give yourself more options. This is also the best way to improve your luck.
6. It’s okay if you gave your best and failed. It’s not okay if you failed and didn’t give your best.
7. All my life, I thought I would backpack forever and only fancy people stay in resorts or five-star hotels. Lately, I’ve stayed in a few good places, and now I get it. If you pay more, you get better experiences.
8. If a service or product is bad, rather than being annoyed, give feedback so that it can improve in the future.
9. Buy a good memory foam pillow. I still don’t have it, but I tried it once for a night, and it was awesome.
10. The feeling to quit while pushing your body to the limit is the same for everyone, be it an Olympian or a world champion. They all feel the same. What matters is how you respond to that feeling and keep moving.
11. Try to consume as few calories through liquids as possible. Very few animals do that in the animal kingdom, and you shouldn’t either.
12. Never let your curiosity fade. It’s the path to opportunities, luck, and eventually success and fulfillment.
13. No one really writes an app and puts it on the app store for free. If it’s free, either you have to pay more for features, or chances are the app isn’t that good.
14. You don’t have to like everything you do at work. At some point in their career, every passionate person would have been forced to do something they didn’t like.
15. Create a plan for anything you do, be it training, studying, or anything else. Things might not always go according to plan, but a plan gives you a sense of direction to excel.
16. It’s easier to lose a habit than to make one. Never miss a habit for two consecutive days.
17. Don’t drink coffee after 3 PM, as it messes up your sleep even if you’re not sensitive to coffee. I’ve tried it and proved it myself, but for some scientific backing, listen to neuroscientist Andrew Huberman’s podcast.
18. It’s okay not to do anything during vacation or while traveling. A hectic schedule will make you tired by the end of your trip, and that’s not what everyone wants.
19. Plan your taxes at the beginning of the financial year. Especially if you’re living in India, there are provisions for deductions, and you can save a lot by planning accordingly. I didn’t, and I’m losing a lot on deductions this year.
20. Don’t try to explain art to someone who doesn’t care or understand it. You might be passionate about it, but the other person may not have the same perspective.
21. Every time you work out, record your reps and the weights used. This will help in progressive overload next time. I use the Strong app for this.
22. Even if religion or spirituality doesn’t matter to you, it matters to others. Religion or spirituality gives hope to those who believe in it, and you have no right to offend anyone’s beliefs.
23. Degrease and grease your bike/cycle every 200 km. Use WD-40 to degrease the chain, soap to remove the dirt, and dry it with a cloth. A smooth drivetrain ensures a smoother ride and longevity of your moving parts like chain/cassette.
24. Never take your credit card when you go to a party and drink. Chances are you might get drunk and end up overspending or buying drinks for others.
25. The majority of people who work in the sustainability space don’t actually care about it. They happen to do it by accident or out of no choice. Most are driven by money, fame, or power, not the environment.
26. Living in a village for the last couple of years, I never cared about the Air Quality Index (AQI). When I moved to Delhi, I ignored the AQI warnings and continued roaming outdoors. I ended up with a severe throat infection within a week and learned the hard way. Just because millions live in a city with hazardous air quality doesn’t mean it’s safe.
27. It’s okay to be lost even when you’re nearing your 30s. It takes time to develop an understanding of the world and your place in it.
28. You're never going to read all the books you want, or watch all the shows, or do everything you wish to. Appreciate the finitude.
