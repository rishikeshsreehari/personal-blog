<p class="has-drop-cap">
  I started journaling when the second wave of Covid-19 hit India in April 2021. I&#8217;m not a daily journal guy even though I would like to make it a daily habit. I journal my thoughts occasionally on Obsidian in digital format using markdown language. I also maintain an <a href="https://rishikeshs.com/idea-journal/" title="Idea Journal">Idea Journal in public</a>, a<a href="https://rishikeshs.com/resonance-journal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Resonance Journal as a Tool for Self-Discovery"> resonance journal in Notion</a> and a private art journal in <a href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. The only journal I write in physical form is my <strong>Stress Journal</strong>. I don&#8217;t know where I got the idea, but I think I read about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/rishikeshshari" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://twitter.com/rishikeshshari">Twitter</a> (I wish I knew the source so that I could credit it). If you don&#8217;t know what journaling is, it&#8217;s a self-practice where you record your thoughts and emotions in a diary be it digital or physical.

    Do you know whatâ€™s common between Albert Einstein, Anne Frank, Marie Curie, Frida Kahlo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Frederick Douglas? They all kept journals.

&lt;sub>This is how entries in stress journal look like. &lt;/sub></code></pre>

The idea of a stress journal is simple. Any time you face anxiety or stress, write the date and write about the feeling and what triggered it. I usually give it a score out of five&nbsp;to indicate how much it bothers me. Every time I open the journal to write a new entry, I go through all the previous entries. I cross out entries that don&#8217;t bother me anymore. This helps me to reflect on times where I have felt stressed, but it was short-lived.

Journaling about stress gives me a perspective of all things that bother me. Sometimes we get stressed about things that aren&#8217;t big enough to be anxious about. I had this feeling that I&#8217;m stressed all the time but the journal gave me an insight into how stress-free my life is. Even the silly things which bother us are temporary, and it&#8217;s a great way to reflect on our thoughts!
