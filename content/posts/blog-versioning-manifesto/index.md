## Introduction

Maintaining a clear and organized record of changes to your blog is essential for both your readers and yourself. This manifesto outlines the principles and practices for effective versioning and changelog management tailored specifically for a personal blog. 

## Guiding Principles

1. **Changelogs are for humans, not machines**: Entries should be written in a way that is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
2. **Every version is documented**: Ensure there is an entry for each version of your blog, no matter how small the change.
3. **Group similar changes**: Categorize changes to improve readability.
4. **Linkable versions and sections**: Each version and section should be easily referenced with a direct link.
5. **Latest version first**: Always list the most recent changes at the top to keep the most current information easily accessible.
6. **Include release dates**: Display the release date for each version to provide context for the changes.
7. **Follow Semantic Versioning**: Use a versioning system that clearly reflects the nature and impact of changes.

## Types of Changes

- **Added**: Introduction of new features, posts, or sections.
- **Changed**: Updates to existing content, features, or design elements.
- **Deprecated**: Features or content that are planned to be removed in future updates.
- **Removed**: Features or content that have been removed.
- **Fixed**: Corrections to errors or bugs.
- **Security**: Updates addressing security vulnerabilities.

## Changelog Example

Here is an example of how to format a changelog entry based on these principles:

```markdown
