**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

It was a decent watch with some thrilling moments. Loved the performance of the captain and also the DRS. I felt that there were a lot of holes in the script and many questions were left unanswered. I won't comment on the inaccuracies, but I felt {{< spoiler >}} the terrorists were portrayed too nicely. Not sure if they were actually this nice in real life!{{< /spoiler >}}

Also, I have a couple of questions that baffle me:  
{{< spoiler >}}
- What was the whole point of that reporter and the newspaper?
- What was the deal with the RAW officer on the flight? What was that about?
- Who the hell cares about business class when you're being hijacked?
- Why weren’t the names of the hijackers mentioned?

{{< /spoiler >}}

Overall, a decent watch with solid performances and filmmaking, with no lag!
