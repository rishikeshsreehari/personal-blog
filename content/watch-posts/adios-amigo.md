**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

Please do yourself a favor and don't even try watching this. Movies like this shouldn't even exist.

Such a bad movie, except for a few glimpses where Suraj excelled in serious situations. Asif Ali, as usual, was a letdown. His 'Boss-ee' calling irked me so much that it felt like it was ringing inside my brain even after the movie was finished. I came across this movie on Netflix as it was apparently trending in the UAE, probably due to the Kerala demographic. The only reason we decided to finish watching it was to see what the hell they were trying to convey. I'm agitated! Worst way to spend 2.5 hours of my life!
