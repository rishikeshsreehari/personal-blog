**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD ⚠️**

Felt like a cooked up script to reach the climax. There were no moments of visual tension or emotional connection. Vijay Sethupathi's performance was a letdown. Anurag Kashyap tried, but his body language and acting felt unnatural at moments. I think there were issues with dubbing as well. Overall, standout performances were by the actress who played the Jyothi character and also the actor who played Nallasivam. Overall, the direction and script were a letdown. There were no moments of brilliant cinematography and the movie had zero impact on me.
