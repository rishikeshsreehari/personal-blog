**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD ⚠️**

Loved the performances of all the artists except Sanjeev Mehra's wife. The direction was decent; there weren't many "wow" moments in cinematography, but overall, it was decent. However, the story and script itself were a letdown. There were unnecessary plots here and there, too many personal stories, and a weird climax that is not at all believable. I can't believe they did all this just to kill a guy! Countless stories for no reason – the story of a transgender, the story of an accountant, the story of a stupid sports teacher, the story of a stupid brother-in-law who sells weird soda machines, and many more. Ansari was just in the story to bring the Hindu-Muslim feud in the country into the plot. Jaideep Ahlawat lived the character, and overall, the dialogues in the movie were spot on. Overall predictable story, great performances, but story a let down!
