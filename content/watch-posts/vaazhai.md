**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**


An interesting movie with exceptional acting and cinematography. Everyone acted so well, especially Sekar and Sivanandhan's mother. While I was watching, all I could think of was how many frames were so similar to [Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam](https://letterboxd.com/film/nanpakal-nerathu-mayakkam/), which I loved. Apparently, the cinematographer is the same for both movies, which explains the resemblance.

Coming to the negatives, I felt the script lacked depth in terms of storyline. Some frames and moments, although beautiful, felt out of place and seemed like they were used as mere fillers.{{< spoiler >}} While the climax was sad, it didn't really touch me. I felt there was a lot of potential in the part where Sivanandhan was eating despite the tragedies. I'm not sure what the underlying thread was—was it hunger, caste oppression as everyone says, or just the everyday struggle of life?{{< /spoiler >}}

Considering this is sort of a memoir, it was good, but nothing outstanding apart from the acting and cinematography. I wish the makers had worked a bit more on the script to make it more impactful, considering there was a lot of potential. Probably I missed some emotions since I'm not a Tamil speaker. Overall, great acting, direction, and cinematography, but the script lacked depth and failed to convey emotions at times.
