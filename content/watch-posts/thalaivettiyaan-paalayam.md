**⚠️ SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK TO REVEAL! ⚠️**

This is a Tamil adaptation of the popular series [Panchayat](https://www.serializd.com/show/Panchayat-101352) by Netflix. Nothing much to say—excellent performances, direction, and cinematography. The comedy was spot on, and I felt like I was living in that village. As I'm writing this, I'm humming the title song and imagining the title sequence. The dynamics between Sundaram and Meenakshi were also a delight to watch. Later, I found out that they are actually a couple in real life!

Overall, a great, refreshing watch!

Probably I would watch the Hindi version soon!
