This is a list of all the books I can remember reading. Since I remember them, most are pretty good. Again, they are in roughly descending order of subjective quality. If you want to see books I hope to read in the future, see my anti-library.

Starting in 2021, I decided to track all the books I read. 



<table id="myTable" data-sort="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Book Name</th>
      <th>Rating</th>
      <th>Date Read</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</td>
      <td>★★★☆☆</td>
      <td>Feb 2023</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Doglapan</td>
      <td>★★☆☆☆</td>
      <td>Feb 2023</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>So Good that They Can't Ignore You</td>
      <td>★★★★☆</td>
      <td>Jan 2023</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
