![Books read per year](/images/books_read_per_year.svg) 

This is a list of all the books I can remember reading. Since I remember them, most are pretty good. Again, they are in roughly descending order of subjective quality. If you want to see books I hope to read in the future, see my anti-library.

Starting in 2021, I decided to track all the books I read. 






| Book Name |  Rating | Date Read |
| ---------|-------|-----------|
| Jonathan Livingston Seagull     |  ★★★☆☆ | Feb 2023  |
| Doglapan    | ★★☆☆☆ | Feb 2023  |
| So Good that They Can't Ignore You     | ★★★★☆ | Jan 2023  |
