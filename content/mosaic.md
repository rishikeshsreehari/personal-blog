I built this page for fun, inspired by Aaron Parecki's [Pixel Art](https://aaronparecki.com/2018/01/21/11/pixel-art). When a visitor clicks on a pixel in the grid, it changes to a random color. The data is stored, and the location of the user is checked. If the location is unique, it is also displayed at the bottom. In summary, it's a simple public pixel art project!
