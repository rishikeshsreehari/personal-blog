        "html": "<p>I enjoyed hosting February\u2019s IndieWeb Carnival. </p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who shared based on the prompt. \u201c<strong>Affirmations</strong>\u201d invited participants to engage with their inner voices, inner lives, and <em>meaning. </em>And the folks who submitted their posts did so. There were 30 submissions and whether folks left a comment, sent an email, replied in the fediverse or IndieWeb chat I was delighted as each one came in. </p>\n<p>What follows are the submissions, in alphabetical order by domain name.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrei.xyz/post/affirmations/\">Affirmations</a> from <a href=\"https://andrei.xyz\">andrei.xyz</a></p>\n<p>Andrei likened affirmations to mantras and also aphorisms. I appreciated seeing, and I certainly hope it\u2019s true that <em>Do your best, all the time, and the people that need to see it will see it.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://artlung.com/blog/2025/02/28/breathe/\">\u201cBreathe\u201d</a> from <a href=\"https://artlung.com\">artlung.com</a></p>\n<p>I worked several evenings on a comic of this post but could not get it to a ready point. In the spirit of \u201cbe kind to yourself\u201d I viewed that not as a failure but as an opportunity to review my success in fixing my bot and decided after much deliberation on my favorite affirmation: \u201c<em>Breathe.</em>\u201d I also got to tell a bit more about how I first encountered the idea of affirmations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.avas.space/indieweb-affirmations-2025/\">affirmations</a> from <a href=\"https://blog.avas.space\">avas.space</a></p>\n<p>Ava shared a <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3RX4WOhLS77zAo8FCeXK86?si=swn6CQ1tRFSo3Oq8VKYx5Q\">playlist</a> of positive music at the end of her post. Before that she shares her story of a painful breakup and how she used writing as a balm, and a kind of <em>plan</em> to find a positive way forward. And she uses the phrase <em>\u201ccrafting a story for ourselves\u201d </em>in this post which is a useful frame for our inner lives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.darylsun.page/2025/02/14/se-7-indieweb-carnival-february-2025\">Special Edition \u2014 Affirmations</a> from <a href=\"https://blog.darylsun.page\">darylsun.page</a></p>\n<p>I learned a new trope: <em>\u201csurvival mantra\u201d</em> from Daryl\u2019s post. Read the whole post, but this bit? Perfect.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In moments of plenty, enjoy them, because blessings can fade away with the wind. In moments of scarcity, don\u2019t despair, because trials don\u2019t last forever. After all, the only thing constant in life is change. All we can do is keep moving forward.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://bluebottles.bearblog.dev/therapy-takeaways/\">Therapy Takeaways</a> from <a href=\"https://bluebottles.bearblog.dev\">bluebottles.bearblog.dev</a></p>\n<p>Blue Bottles shared a journey specifically related to therapy and the usage of affirmations during therapy. It aligns very closely with my own experiences. And I remember one of the affirmations from BB\u2019s post, and how I struggled to be able to say it to myself. After many years, I can.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s okay to make mistakes</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://britthub.co.uk/imperfect-affirmations/\">Imperfect Affirmations </a> from <a href=\"https://britthub.co.uk\">britthub.co.uk</a></p>\n<p>Britt made a zine (!) to go with their post. <a href=\"https://brittcoxon.itch.io/imperfect-affirmations\">Zine Link</a>. The post also goes into a bit more background and links to resources about the ideas behind affirmations which I really appreciated. And like Blue Bottles many great affirmations are included.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.artlung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/I-enjoy-learning-new-things.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"329\" height=\"425\" /><a href=\"https://brittcoxon.itch.io/imperfect-affirmations\">Pay nothing or what you want link</a><p><a href=\"https://brucebeaumont.bearblog.dev/the-liberation-of-limitations/\">The Liberation of Limitations.</a> from <a href=\"https://brucebeaumont.bearblog.dev\">brucebeaumont.bearblog.dev</a></p>\n<p>While Bruce doesn\u2019t use the word \u201caffirmation\u201d in his post, it nonetheless manages to interrogate black and white photography as a lens to look at limitations and how they can provide opportunities. I appreciated the bit where he mentioned <em>\u201cfocus on the concept of what you are doing.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://danielsavage.uk/2025/02/12/adjusting-my-inner-narrator/\">Adjusting My Inner Narrator</a> from <a href=\"https://danielsavage.uk\">danielsavage.uk</a></p>\n<p>Daniel shared 3 terrific affirmations in his post. And addressed specifically the idea of an inner voice. I suspect everyone an inner voice in some form. He shares vulnerably how he came to affirmations and can\u2019t resist a bit of cheekiness when he realizes the funny acrostic they might form. He made me think, feel, and chuckle. Truly the best blog posts can do that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dead.garden/blog/affirmations.html\">Affirmations</a> from <a href=\"https://dead.garden\">dead.garden</a></p>\n<p>Jo is among my favorite fellow IndieWeb creators. She reckons with the negative affirmations that are part of her, and how she copes and reasons and wrestles them. And she also includes a great illustration with the text <em>\u201cit\u2019s okay to fuck up\u201d </em>which is absolutely a terrific affirmation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drmollytov.bearblog.dev/even-when-it-hurts/\">even when it hurts</a> from <a href=\"https://drmollytov.bearblog.dev\">drmollytov.bearblog.dev</a></p>\n<p>dr molly tov\u2019s post is a beautiful heartbreaker. molly is a widow and reckons with the <em>positive </em>things people say in the face of bad things that happen. molly made the absolutely essential point \u2014 \u201c<em>Some problems \u2026 cannot be fixed.\u201d </em>I like to think molly\u2019s post could be a guide for how to talk to people experiencing great loss. Lovely piece, thank you, dr.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eladnarra.com/blog/2025/affirmations/\">Affirmations</a> from <a href=\"https://www.eladnarra.com\">eladnarra.com</a></p>\n<p>In ela\u2019s post she share her skepticisms around affirmations. I\u2019m so glad she invoked the specter of some of the \u201ctoxic positivity\u201d end of affirmations: \u201cprosperity gospel\u201d and \u201claws of atttration.\u201d These are ideas that say that the reason for failure is a lack of faith. And as in molly\u2019s post, it\u2019s probably <em><strong>not related </strong></em>to faith that things go bad. Some things just happen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fractalkitty.com/math-ffirmations/\">Math-ffirmations</a> from <a href=\"https://www.fractalkitty.com\">fractalkitty.com</a></p>\n<p>Fractal Kitty was first in the gate with a post for this carnival and provided mathematical equations around balance which were and still are a delight to ponder. <em>\u201cBe ever changing\u201d </em>&amp; <em>\u201cSeek beauty in the irrational\u201d </em>and their accompanying equations are my favorites.</p>\n<p>Her post coming first set the bar high, but every new post kept that high bar high.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gregorlove.com/2025/02/affirmations-and-aspirations/\">Affirmations and Aspirations</a> from <a href=\"https://gregorlove.com\">gregorlove.com</a></p>\n<p>gRegor tackled the political moment we are in the midst of. I have broken bread many times with gRegor and so his fearless introspection and upset about the world, and reckoning with <em>what to do next </em>remains what I appreciate about him and his website and writing. He also includes a link to a beautiful song by Andre Henry. Check it out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hamatti.org/posts/my-mom-believes-theres-a-silver-lining/\">My mom believes there\u2019s a silver lining</a> from <a href=\"https://hamatti.org\">hamatti.org</a></p>\n<p>Juhis\u2019 post title says it. But despite a healthy skepticism he can\u2019t help but also mention as an aside <em>\u201cI believe the world would be a lot better place if instead we\u2019d have people with more humility and compassion. But that\u2019s another story.\u201d</em> \u2014 that\u2019s a truth always worth telling. I interpreted his post as thinking affirmations might be used to gaslight oneself, and I do think that\u2019s a special kind of risk to be mindful of. As in the math-ffirmations, balance is a worthy goal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jamesg.blog/2025/02/04/small-things-i-am-proud-of-today/\">Small things I am proud of today</a> from <a href=\"https://jamesg.blog\">jamesg.blog</a></p>\n<p>James\u2019 post is introspective in a way that means a lot to me. Projects started, pondering whether a piece of writing belongs just to him or might be public, and sharing pieces of other writing. James has a way with words. It\u2019s a delight to read him turning his feelings and goals into words.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ken.fyi/some-days\">Some days will be bad</a> from <a href=\"https://ken.fyi\">ken.fyi</a></p>\n<p>Ken, a word person with chronic illness, and is also a new parent, so when he shares : \u201cSome days will be bad\u201d the words sizzle with truth. And even in the face of that he manages to share a spirit of self-forgiveness and taking things as they come.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kuchaiblog.ribbits.dev/2025/progress-not-perfection-indieweb-carnival-affirmations\">progress, not perfection</a> from <a href=\"https://kuchaiblog.ribbits.dev\">kuchaiblog.ribbits.dev</a></p>\n<p>kuchaibee\u2019s post is succinct and terrific. I\u2019ll quote the first paragraph. But please click through and read.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, affirmations are positive ideas and worldviews that help me center myself. I\u2019m a person whose mind skews negatively and I get the tendencies to be stuck in bad moods occasionally, which is why the deliberate act of remembering positive things helps keep me grounded and helps me focus on what really matters in life. It\u2019s also this reason that I\u2019m very proactive about curating my feeds, and being very selective about what media, hobbies, and communities I partake in.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://louplummer.lol/affirmations-indie-web-carnival-for-february-2025/\">Affirmations \u2013 Indieweb Carnival</a> from <a href=\"https://louplummer.lol\">louplummer.lol</a></p>\n<p>Lou is a bit older than some submitters. I appreciated his inclusion of multiple aspects which contribute to well being \u2013 the physical, the emotional, the all of it. He emphasizes the need to find <em>meaning </em>in life. And I dug it all. I also appreciated two of the affirmations he shared, which are ones which I am definitely adding to my repertoire:</p>\n<ul><li><em>I react calmly to stressful situations</em></li>\n<li><em>I am intelligent and resourceful. I find solutions to problems. I am not defeated by them.</em></li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://mrtnmrls.com/affirmations-huentitan-ravine\">Affirmations \u2013 Huentit\u00e1n\u2019s ravine</a> <span lang=\"es\" xml:lang=\"es\">(<a lang=\"es\" title=\"Afirmaciones - Barranca de Huentit\u00e1n\" href=\"https://mrtnmrls.com/es/affirmations-huentitan-ravine\" xml:lang=\"es\">y en espa\u00f1ol</a>)</span> from <a href=\"https://mrtnmrls.com\">mrtnmrls.com</a></p>\n<p>Mart\u00edn shared in both English and Spanish and I appreciated that so much. I loved that he talked about self-encouragement and that an inner voice that can help us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rishikeshs.com/be-curious/\">Be Curious, Always</a> from <a href=\"https://rishikeshs.com\">rishikeshs.com</a></p>\n<p>Rishikesh shares an incredibly vulnerable piece about some tough times and bouncing back. He interrogates whether he may not have affirmations of any kind, and looks into why that is, and looks inward to see what inner guidance he <em>does </em>have. I utterly identify with questioning the notion of affirmations while more-or-less working on affirmations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rossabaker.com/blog/pareto-frontal-affirmation/\">Pareto-frontal affirmation</a> from <a href=\"https://rossabaker.com\">rossabaker.com</a></p>\n<p>Ross made me laugh out loud with this line:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s only emotional reticence if you were raised in the Midwest. Elsewhere, it\u2019s just sparkling introversion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But still, he managed to lean in and get introspective, with a fine dosage of snark too. I suspect that bit of snark keeps his inner voices in balance, and loved getting this final piece in the final hours of February.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sarahgebauer.com/desk/just-keep-swimming/\">Just Keep Swimming</a> from <a href=\"https://www.sarahgebauer.com\">sarahgebauer.com</a></p>\n<p>Sarah prefaces her piece with the admission that she grew up with affirmations deployed by problematic New Agers. That would definitely put me off affirmations. Still she finds use out of pop culture affirmations like <em>\u201cjust keep swimming\u201d</em> and <em>Dune</em>\u2018s reminder that <em>\u201cfear is the mind killer.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>When I think about memes I don\u2019t think about cats, I think about ideas with power. And Sarah\u2019s post reminds me of that. Movie or book quotes can encapsulate ideas for us that can be terrifically constructive.</p>\n<p>Just because it\u2019s fiction doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2025/02/indieweb-carnival-debruary-2025-affirmations-arent-battle-strategy-for-me/\">Affirmations aren\u2019t battle strategy for me</a> from <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu\">sarajaksa.eu</a></p>\n<p>Sarah more-or-less brought writing prompts to the IndieWeb, and her submission includes drawings too.

And addressed specifically the idea of an inner voice. I suspect everyone an inner voice in some form.

As in the math-ffirmations, balance is a worthy goal.\nSmall things I am proud of today from jamesg.blog\nJames\u2019 post is introspective in a way that means a lot to me. Projects started, pondering whether a piece of writing belongs just to him or might be public, and sharing pieces of other writing. James has a way with words.

I\u2019ll quote the first paragraph. But please click through and read.\nFor me, affirmations are positive ideas and worldviews that help me center myself. I\u2019m a person whose mind skews negatively and I get the tendencies to be stuck in bad moods occasionally, which is why the deliberate act of remembering positive things helps keep me grounded and helps me focus on what really matters in life.

I find solutions to problems. I am not defeated by them.\nAffirmations \u2013 Huentit\u00e1n\u2019s ravine (y en espa\u00f1ol) from mrtnmrls.com\nMart\u00edn shared in both English and Spanish and I appreciated that so much.

I suspect that bit of snark keeps his inner voices in balance, and loved getting this final piece in the final hours of February.\nJust Keep Swimming from sarahgebauer.com\nSarah prefaces her piece with the admission that she grew up with affirmations deployed by problematic New Agers. That would definitely put me off affirmations. Still she finds use out of pop culture affirmations like \u201cjust keep swimming\u201d and Dune\u2018s reminder that \u201cfear is the mind killer.\u201d\nWhen I think about memes I don\u2019t think about cats, I think about ideas with power. And Sarah\u2019s post reminds me of that.

        "text": "I enjoyed hosting February\u2019s IndieWeb Carnival. \nThank you to everyone who shared based on the prompt. \u201cAffirmations\u201d invited participants to engage with their inner voices, inner lives, and meaning. And the folks who submitted their posts did so. There were 30 submissions and whether folks left a comment, sent an email, replied in the fediverse or IndieWeb chat I was delighted as each one came in. \nWhat follows are the submissions, in alphabetical order by domain name.\nAffirmations from andrei.xyz\nAndrei likened affirmations to mantras and also aphorisms. I appreciated seeing, and I certainly hope it\u2019s true that Do your best, all the time, and the people that need to see it will see it.\n\u201cBreathe\u201d from artlung.com\nI worked several evenings on a comic of this post but could not get it to a ready point. In the spirit of \u201cbe kind to yourself\u201d I viewed that not as a failure but as an opportunity to review my success in fixing my bot and decided after much deliberation on my favorite affirmation: \u201cBreathe.\u201d I also got to tell a bit more about how I first encountered the idea of affirmations.\naffirmations from avas.space\nAva shared a playlist of positive music at the end of her post. Before that she shares her story of a painful breakup and how she used writing as a balm, and a kind of plan to find a positive way forward. And she uses the phrase \u201ccrafting a story for ourselves\u201d in this post which is a useful frame for our inner lives.\nSpecial Edition \u2014 Affirmations from darylsun.page\nI learned a new trope: \u201csurvival mantra\u201d from Daryl\u2019s post. Read the whole post, but this bit? Perfect.\nIn moments of plenty, enjoy them, because blessings can fade away with the wind. In moments of scarcity, don\u2019t despair, because trials don\u2019t last forever. After all, the only thing constant in life is change. All we can do is keep moving forward.\nTherapy Takeaways from bluebottles.bearblog.dev\nBlue Bottles shared a journey specifically related to therapy and the usage of affirmations during therapy. It aligns very closely with my own experiences. And I remember one of the affirmations from BB\u2019s post, and how I struggled to be able to say it to myself. After many years, I can.\nIt\u2019s okay to make mistakes\nImperfect Affirmations  from britthub.co.uk\nBritt made a zine (!) to go with their post. Zine Link. The post also goes into a bit more background and links to resources about the ideas behind affirmations which I really appreciated. And like Blue Bottles many great affirmations are included.\nPay nothing or what you want linkThe Liberation of Limitations. from brucebeaumont.bearblog.dev\nWhile Bruce doesn\u2019t use the word \u201caffirmation\u201d in his post, it nonetheless manages to interrogate black and white photography as a lens to look at limitations and how they can provide opportunities. I appreciated the bit where he mentioned \u201cfocus on the concept of what you are doing.\u201d\nAdjusting My Inner Narrator from danielsavage.uk\nDaniel shared 3 terrific affirmations in his post. And addressed specifically the idea of an inner voice. I suspect everyone an inner voice in some form. He shares vulnerably how he came to affirmations and can\u2019t resist a bit of cheekiness when he realizes the funny acrostic they might form. He made me think, feel, and chuckle. Truly the best blog posts can do that.\nAffirmations from dead.garden\nJo is among my favorite fellow IndieWeb creators. She reckons with the negative affirmations that are part of her, and how she copes and reasons and wrestles them. And she also includes a great illustration with the text \u201cit\u2019s okay to fuck up\u201d which is absolutely a terrific affirmation.\neven when it hurts from drmollytov.bearblog.dev\ndr molly tov\u2019s post is a beautiful heartbreaker. molly is a widow and reckons with the positive things people say in the face of bad things that happen. molly made the absolutely essential point \u2014 \u201cSome problems \u2026 cannot be fixed.\u201d I like to think molly\u2019s post could be a guide for how to talk to people experiencing great loss. Lovely piece, thank you, dr.\nAffirmations from eladnarra.com\nIn ela\u2019s post she share her skepticisms around affirmations. I\u2019m so glad she invoked the specter of some of the \u201ctoxic positivity\u201d end of affirmations: \u201cprosperity gospel\u201d and \u201claws of atttration.\u201d These are ideas that say that the reason for failure is a lack of faith. And as in molly\u2019s post, it\u2019s probably not related to faith that things go bad. Some things just happen.\nMath-ffirmations from fractalkitty.com\nFractal Kitty was first in the gate with a post for this carnival and provided mathematical equations around balance which were and still are a delight to ponder. \u201cBe ever changing\u201d & \u201cSeek beauty in the irrational\u201d and their accompanying equations are my favorites.\nHer post coming first set the bar high, but every new post kept that high bar high.\nAffirmations and Aspirations from gregorlove.com\ngRegor tackled the political moment we are in the midst of. I have broken bread many times with gRegor and so his fearless introspection and upset about the world, and reckoning with what to do next remains what I appreciate about him and his website and writing. He also includes a link to a beautiful song by Andre Henry. Check it out.\nMy mom believes there\u2019s a silver lining from hamatti.org\nJuhis\u2019 post title says it. But despite a healthy skepticism he can\u2019t help but also mention as an aside \u201cI believe the world would be a lot better place if instead we\u2019d have people with more humility and compassion. But that\u2019s another story.\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s a truth always worth telling. I interpreted his post as thinking affirmations might be used to gaslight oneself, and I do think that\u2019s a special kind of risk to be mindful of. As in the math-ffirmations, balance is a worthy goal.\nSmall things I am proud of today from jamesg.blog\nJames\u2019 post is introspective in a way that means a lot to me. Projects started, pondering whether a piece of writing belongs just to him or might be public, and sharing pieces of other writing. James has a way with words. It\u2019s a delight to read him turning his feelings and goals into words.\nSome days will be bad from ken.fyi\nKen, a word person with chronic illness, and is also a new parent, so when he shares : \u201cSome days will be bad\u201d the words sizzle with truth. And even in the face of that he manages to share a spirit of self-forgiveness and taking things as they come.\nprogress, not perfection from kuchaiblog.ribbits.dev\nkuchaibee\u2019s post is succinct and terrific. I\u2019ll quote the first paragraph. But please click through and read.\nFor me, affirmations are positive ideas and worldviews that help me center myself. I\u2019m a person whose mind skews negatively and I get the tendencies to be stuck in bad moods occasionally, which is why the deliberate act of remembering positive things helps keep me grounded and helps me focus on what really matters in life.

I loved that he talked about self-encouragement and that an inner voice that can help us.\nBe Curious, Always from rishikeshs.com\nRishikesh shares an incredibly vulnerable piece about some tough times and bouncing back.
