[{"content":"The Experiment The Man from the Future is a thought experiment that I’ve been exploring over the years to understand the basics of everything we’re experiencing today ranging from food to our gadgets. Human history is quite fascinating and the pleasures we’re enjoying today has been achieved through multiple iterations of science, technology or culture, built upon the knowledge of past generations. The first principle’s thinkingand Thomas Thwaites’s Toaster Projecthad a great influence on this thought experiment. I use this thought experiment as a way to deeply understand our history and human evolution. If I cannot think of a way to do something from scratch, chances are that I do not know everything about it. This is quite daunting considering the number of things we use daily but gives us an idea of the evolution of things over time.\nAnalysis Coming back to the thought experiment, what all things can you build? Do you think you can advance humanity with the complex knowledge you possess in your lifetime in the past? I’ve been thinking about this for a while and have listed down a few things that are essential with possible scenarios to achieve them. The list also includes items that I wanted to achieve but failed due to the lack of knowledge I have. This also questions the depth of knowledge I have on everyday things. I think Yuval Harari said this in Sapiens(not sure!) that the average knowledge of a hunter-gatherer was more than the average knowledge of a modern human. The overall collective knowledge of humanity has increased over years, but at a personal scale, the amount of collective knowledge has decreased.\nThis is a working article and will be updated accordingly as I explore more ideas.\n Tools: A tool like a knife is essential to survive and build humanity. A tool with metals is not possible until the discovery and extraction of metals, but one with a stone can be easily made. Hit a sharp stone with another or file it against another rock to make a basic knife or shrapnel to cut trees and branches. Thanks to some survival YouTube videos I have seen! Rope: The tool would be better with a wooden handle. Some ropes are to secure the wooden stick with the stone tool. I can use some long roots or strong climbers or hanging branches as ropes for these purposes. Shelter: With the tool I have and human resources available, I can make some basic houses for shelter. I can use tree logs and branches to create a strong structure secured by ropes collected. The roof can be covered using palm leaves or any other branch cut using a knife. I need to build this shelter as close to the water as possible. Fire: Fire is very important for survival, but as I’m writing this I realized I don’t really know much about making fire from scratch. When I was young, I had tried and failed to make fire using stones. I know fire can be made using rotating a piece of wood against another, but what kind of wood should I use? I’m not really confident about this as I’ve never done this. I wish I had known how flint rocks look in nature. Food: Finding food is tricky since nature is untouched. Many of the vegetables and fruits that we eat today do not look the same in the wild. What we see and eat today are plants that are being collectively bred by humans over centuries. My best bet in such a scenario would be to find some mushrooms, root plants or berries. But I do not have any idea that is edible or not. At this point with the limited tools I have, catching animals won’t be a good idea. Even if I find food, it would probably suck as there is no salt. If I have a sea or ocean nearby, I can collect some water in a coconut shell and let it dry to collect some salt. Agriculture: Agriculture is key for my survival and the tribes. Every time I eat something, I need to store the seeds or stem of the plant to reproduce it at a scale next time. But how do I group things? I do not have a label maker or even a pen. I also do not have a pouch or a plastic bag to store the seeds. Better make storage out of stones to store and group these seeds. I can use some plant leaves or flowers to mark these stones as I still remember the alphabet. I’m also not sure whether the seeds I’ve collected will sprout. I need to collect and use them wisely to obtain the right yield. Knowledge: As I do not have any books or electronic media to store information, I need to find a way to store the information I acquire over the days. At a basic level, I need to develop some sort of a pictorial writing system until I figure out how to make paper and some sort of pen and ink. Fishing: Fishes are an excellent source of protein low in fat with omega-3 fatty acids. Since the tribe lives near the water body, it’s an easier source of food. I can use some stone tools that are attached to a wooden stick to make some sort of spear to catch fish in the shallow waters. I do not know which fish I shouldn’t eat but I guess at this point everything is edible. I also need to train a few members of the tribe on how to swim and dive. Diving is essential as some shellfish live on the bottom portion of the water body and are excellent sources of protein. Transportation: Over time as I expand my civilization, transportation is essential. The idea of the wheel is simple but making it is quite tough in the wild with primitive tools. The idea here is to dedicate some human resources to making some wheels from logs of wood and stones by carving and filing. Ideally, I want to build some sort of cart with a wooden axle supported by four stone or wooden wheels. Animals: As I’m writing this, I feel like this is quite unethical. But for the survival of my species, I feel like animals are essential. What animals should I tame and how do I tame? Can I find a cow in the wild? Can I find a rooster and a hen in the world? I don’t think dogs exist as wolves are their ancestor. Catching and taming a wolf or buffalo at this point is quite tricky. I’m clueless at this point. But as my cart is getting ready, I would need some animals to pull it. Irrigation: If I’m planning on agriculture, water is key for its growth. How do I transport water from the river to the fields? I can ask my people to dig some canals as this is the most practical thing to do. Or should I use some bamboo water pipes to bring water? I feel like this part is quite easy and doable. Clothing: Is clothing necessary at this point in time? I don’t think there are enough resources to ensure clothing for everyone. I can try to make some clothing using leaves or animal skin. Some palm leaves with some ropes can be used to make a basic skirt. Time: Tracking time is vital as this can help me predict seasons. But how do I track time? Should I use a cave wall to mark the number of days? But what day is today? Which season are we going through now? This is quite tricky. Food Preservation: Once I have figured out the timings of seasons, it is now time to look at preserving food. How do I preserve food? I know how to preserve fish with salt and sunlight. I can also preserve meat and some vegetables the same way, but the success can be achieved only by some trial and error. Another problem is where will I store the preserved food? Do rats exist in the wild? How do I create a makeshift storage space with the limited resources I have? Education: So far my tribe members have obeyed me, but we do not communicate. We communicate through some actions, but I feel it is time to teach them some language. What language should I teach them? I feel like English is quite complicated for a primitive population. How do I design a new language or how are languages formed? If I die someday accidentally, it is important that I preserve the knowledge for future generations. But how do I preserve it? Should I build a new language from scratch?  The End As I’m writing this, I’ve realized that much knowledge I possess like electromagnetism, string theory, aerodynamics, etc is of no use until the civilization advances to a point. I had much fun writing this post and will update it as I get more ideas over time. Meanwhile, drop your comments on things that you feel you can achieve.\n","permalink":"https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/man-from-the-future/","summary":"The Experiment The Man from the Future is a thought experiment that I’ve been exploring over the years to understand the basics of everything we’re experiencing today ranging from food to our gadgets.

In 2021 alone, the creator economy has seen a record funding of $1.3 billion. The cost of creating content continues to go down as more content creators are appearing online. The shift of content creation from big corporations to independent small creators around the globe has resulted in an age where we are overloaded with the vast availability of information. Decentralised and democratised content on the internet is driving this creator boom.\nAge of Information Overload With the creator economy booming, sorting content from the vast universe of information is becoming harder day by day. The information you want to read is already there but is buried in the vast piles of articles, videos and blog posts. We are currently in an era overloaded with information. Every day we are bombarded with the never-ending streams of irrelevant content and it is easy to get lost in that. Here are some numbersto give you some context:\n 300 hours of video is uploaded on YouTube every minute in 2021. 90% of the data on the internet has been created since 2016. By the end of 2020, 44 Zettabytesof data made up the entire digital universe growing at the rate of 1.7 Mb per second per person. Every day 306.4 billion emails are sent and 500 million tweets are made.  Rise of Algorithms vs Human Curation The rise of algorithms replacing humans in curating content started to gain some traction 20 years ago. Amazon replaced humans with algorithmsfor curating product recommendations to users. Algorithms play a major role in the content that we see on the internet today. Algorithms drive 70% of content on YouTube today.Even though algorithms powered by AI are curating large chunks of content for users, the future of content is human to human. Human-to-Human interaction always wins over the logic of algorithms. The AI at present is limited in terms of context when it comes to curation. The main aim of AI is to make users stay on the platform as long as possible. The big difference between AI and humans is the intent behind it. Even though humans are inefficient in processing large chunks of information like AI, a human can bring context to information. A human can analyze content, find common themes and display only the relevant information. Even though AI is here to stay, as of now, it cannot replace human curation. Every curator is different as his/her skills and knowledge are different. So is the curator’s audience. These all factors create a unique combination that cannot be replaced by the AI advancement we have now.\nThe Birth of Curator Economy Curation of content enables users to understand, explore and make sense of the topic or issue by organising the best available information sources on the internet. When the information is served with a context, insights can be easily drawn saving time and effort.\nCuration is one of the 3 Cs of information commerce: Creation, Curation and Consumption. Curation requires time and proper attention to sort through hundreds of articles and posts to recommend information. The curation economy is boomingand over the years curation has become a sustainable business. As mentioned earlier, curation requires some effort and curators often monetize their work for this. To give you some idea of the current state of the content curation economy, here are some examples:\n FlowStateon Substack charges $8/month to get access to curated Spotify lists. The Browsercharges $5/month to access weekly article recommendations. The Browser currently has 10000+ subscribers who pay them annually. The Generalisthas 33,000+ subscribers and generates around $11,000 per month. NowIKnowis a free newsletter that sends interesting things daily to your inbox has over 100,000 subscribers and makes around $1500 per month from patrons. Everything Bundlehas 1000+ paid subscribers within the first month of going premium.  Why Content Curation is Important Based on my experience and research here’s a list of reasons what\nmakes content curation important:\n Information is growing at an all-time high rate every day. There are multiple blogs, social channels and news sources launched every day. This makes finding relevant content more and more difficult. With the rising information tsunami, it becomes hard for people who are inexperienced or new to the internet to identify reliable sources of information. If not checked properly, users are served with spam on misleading content. Webmasters and creators are concerned over the visibility on various platforms, thereby optimizing titles and content for search engine optimization. This often leads to spammy content with clickbaity titles and no relevance. Since the average free time for a person is decreasing, it is essential to only deliver and consume content that is precise, concise and relevant. To get a grasp of the whole idea, some content usually needs to be contextualized.  How to become a Content Curator A content curator is someone who wades through the vastness of information, chooses the best content and presents it in a context to the audience. Proper curation is about understanding the limited amount of time and attention span of the audience that is consuming the content. Best content creators consume large chunks of information, render the best from it to concise pieces of information by highlighting it to the audience.\nFor my newsletter 10+1 Things, I follow the steps below for curation:\n Since curation requires expertise and knowledge, I read extensively ever since I started the newsletter. Every week I read 40+ newsletters, 70+ articles, 2 books and watch 20+ informative or documentary-style videos. Every time I consume an interesting piece of information that triggers my curiosity, I create a note about it on my Knowledge Management platform, Obsidian. On Fridays, from the long list of ideas, I finely curate 11 outstanding stories to create a skeleton for the newsletter. Every story featured will be cross-checked to ensure factual accuracy. Content finalized on Friday will be elaborated on Saturday with further information to match the style and context of the newsletter. Grammar check and readability tests are done to ensure content is delivered the best possible way for the audience.  Conclusion The concept of the curator economy is not new and has been discussed over the years as the future of content. Curation can eventually build a personal brand or audience. Data has shown the content curation is booming and is a sustainable source of income.\nFounder of GlaspThis article is not an original idea and was inspired by researching various articles, research notes and blog posts from the internet.

Wealth is generated when businesses help humans from point A to point B in a more efficient manner. This theory can be used to test an idea or an existing business. The efficiency score of a business solution or approach can be represented on a scale of 1-10 by the amount of efficiency it creates. For example, booking tickets via the IRCTC app(Indian Railways official booking platform) can be given a score of 8 or 9, and going to the railway station can be given a score of 2 or 3.\nThe Delta-4 Theory Kunal Shah, Founder of CREDAccording to Kunal, if the delta of the efficiencies is greater than 4, the business or the solution will unlock the pot of gold. Once the business or the product achieves the delta \u0026gt; 4, it becomes unstoppable and becomes a wealth creation machine. Examples include Uber (Allowing to book cabs easily and efficiently), Google (Helping to search the world of the web faster), Truecaller (Helping to identify an unknown call received), Whatsapp (Making text communication faster, efficient and free), and more.\nTraits of Delta-4 Irreversible Once Delta 4 has been established, it’s impossible for people to go back to the previous state of inefficiency. A person who has booked a flight/train ticket online will never go back to the station or airport to book a ticket again as delta 4 has been already achieved.\nUniversal Bragworthy Position (UBP) \u0026gt; Universal Selling Point(USP) Delta-4 products have UBP so high that it grows organically without the need for any aggressive marketing. One example given by Kunal is that of Truecaller which became popular without any advertisement. The product was so good that people were talking about it and it organically grew itself.\nHigh Tolerance Once Delta 4 is established, people will have a high tolerance towards the product. For example even if Uber is down for an hour or if the ride got canceled due to some error, people continue to use Uber. This is contrary to the businesses which haven’t achieved delta 4. For example, while purchasing clothes online, if it goes wrong one time say due to misfit, people tend to abandon buying clothes online completely and prefer going back to the brick and mortar store.\nExceptions for Delta-4 Affordability Even if Delta4 is achieved, if the technology or product is not affordable, wealth cannot be unlocked. For example, people travel in train in India even though flights are way efficient since flights are comparatively expensive considering the average Indian household’s income.\nReadiness of the Market If a supporting ecosystem is not present in a market, wealth will not be created even when delta 4 is achieved. An example is introducing a cab booking app in a country where smartphones are not popular. Delta-4 may be achieved by a business in such markets where SMS-based cab bookings are offered until smartphones become popular.\nEfforts to Learn If the new business or approach involves a difficult or time-consuming learning curve, wealth cannot be unlocked. One example would be a new software as a replacement for Tally software used by accountants. Since there is a new learning curve, the product may not be successful.\nMicro-Configurations More configurations people have done to an existing product, more would be the friction to adopt a new product. People tend to change operating systems(OS) very little since adapting to a new OS and making those micro-configurations would be time-consuming and tedious.\nCollective Participation If an existing product has already a large user base like Whatsapp, it will be hard to create momentum for a new product that has better features.\nBranded Lanes or Verbs When the state changed from A to B and a brand or verb has been created, it is very difficult to move people from the current state. One example would be phrases like, “Whatsapp me!” or “Google it!”. People are so used to these products that even if a better solution arrives, it will be difficult to onboard them to the new solution.\nFaking Delta-4 Fake Inefficiencies FMCG companies often create fake inefficiencies to achieve Delta-4 state. For instance, nobody cared about dandruff or being fairer 50-60 years ago. FMCG companies created this notion to promote their anti-dandruff shampoos.\nInfluencers Delta-4 can be faked by using influencers in the market. If an influencer, say a sports star or a media personality pretends to follow a product, people tend to adopt the product. Also if a bigger brand uses a service or a product, the smaller brands tend to follow the trend.\nPiggybacking Delta-4 can also be achieved by piggybacking another Delta-4 product. For instance, Anti-fog glass cleaningliquid will sell as long as people continue to buy spectacles. It will survive until the Laser treatment for blindnessachieves Delta-4 state ad people abandon spectacles.\nHow to Evaluate your Idea? Delta-4 Theory can be used by entrepreneurs while formulating ideas for startups or even existing products. It acts as a framework to self-evaluate whether the product or solutions is creating extraordinary value and will create wealth in the future. Problems are a subset of inefficiencies. The theory can also be used to reverse-engineer existing inefficiencies to find a problem and thereby a product.\nIf you’re looking to evaluate an ideaor our existing business, I believe that this article will help you in the process. Please reach out to me if you’re trying to analyze your product or business using this theory.

I’ve structured my newsletter in such a way that it explores some key areas/topics that I’m exploring in my life and during the week. Every edition of my newsletter follows this structure (it has evolved a bit over time) as described below:\n ✍️An article on my blog: The first link is generally a blog post on this blog. This structure forces me to write at least once every week. This also acts as a funnel for building an audience on my personal blog. Some articles like this one have been picked by major publications like Hustle! 🌍Climate/Sustainability: I care a lot about climate change and sustainability. Thus I read a lot of articles in this space and share one article surrounding this topic every week. 📚Books: I try to read at least one book every week although this often results in having multiple books to read parallelly. But I love exploring new books every week and thus a new book is shared every week 🧵Thread: Twitter is the only social media I’m active on and I’m a fan of amazing Twitter threads. Threads do an excellent job in distilling complex information into bite-sized tweets and I actively look for interesting tweets throughout the week. My long-term plan is to write at least one Twitter thread every week, but at the moment it is not sustainable for me and thus I share threads published by other people every week. 👩‍🎨Artist: I love art and would love to be known as an artist in the future. This means I would need to actively explore other people’s artworks. I share one art project that I’ve been exploring every week. 🎬Video: I consume a lot of video content on YouTube/Vimeo every week and try to share some interesting videos every week. This part keeps me mindful about consuming meaningful content and trust me it’s quite hard! 🧪️Science: I try to share some new advancements in Science like a new invention by researchers or new technology. 💡Original Thoughts: This is usually the last and the 11th section of the newsletter and explores an original thought I’m having or some experiment I did. I find a lot of joy in writing this part of the newsletter and some originals like the newsletter strike system were shared by Recomendo! 🔗Other 3 Links: Other 3 links are usually quirky or interesting stories or information that I discovered during the week. These links usually have the most engagement in my newsletter. 📣Shoutouts: I actively look for cross-promotions with other writers to grow my newsletter. This section includes such shoutouts with a one-liner written by me. Sometimes I include some classified links as well but this section is restricted to a maximum of 3 links a week. 💬Quote: I also share an interesting quote I’ve read throughout the week.  This structure has been consistent for the last couple of months in my newsletter and I’ve tweaked this after studying data and feedback from users. This consistent structure allows me to define a process to curate this new letter every week.\nThe Sources Sharing 11 new things every week is no joke and required a lot of passive effort from my end. This commits me to be aware and mindful of the content I’m consuming and seek out interesting things surrounding the structure of my newsletter. My main information sources for my newsletter are:\n Newsletters: Newsletters are my major source of information. I subscribe to at least 50+ newsletters and try to keep my inbox clean by spending 30 minutes every day. I follow a process called the newsletter strike system such that my inbox is never full of any junk information. Some of my favourite newsletters are Farnam Street, Recomendo, Design Lobster, Uncharted Territories, David Perell, Sunday Snippetsby Ali Abdaal and more! Reddit: I like to explore the rabbit holes of information on Reddit and sometimes I find very interesting articles from there. Hacker News: I really love the Hacker News community and find a lot of interesting content that I’ve never seen on the internet there. Twitter: Twitter also sometimes help me to find interesting threads and sources of information. Whenever I read something interesting on Twitter, I research more and usually find interesting content while following the trail! YouTube/Video: I trust YouTube’s recommendation engine to bring me interesting videos every week, even though it has failed multiple times. The only way is to tweak your feed by sending the ‘not interested’ feedback back to the system. I also closely follow Vimeo’s editors’ picks for interesting documentaries and short films. Recommendation Engines: Sampleand Refindare the two recommendation engines that help me find new content and newsletter writers. Samplesends a new newsletter every day for me to explore and Refindsends a list of interesting articles on the topics that I’ve subscribed to! Art Websites: I subscribe to many art websites especially photography magazines, so I’m introduced to various contemporary and fine art projects.  Having an extensive list of information sources is easy, but being organized and disciplined about consuming content is the hardest part. Irrespective of the source of information, the ultimate beauty of curations lies within the curator.\nThe System It is quite important to have a proper system to collect and store the articles and information that I’ve explored using the data sources mentioned in the previous section. Some articles I find are mostly long-form and I collect them such that I can read them later. I’ve seen others selling, sharing and using complex systems built on Notion, Spreadsheets or custom software to track the link. But for me personally, lists work perfect me and I like to have everything in one space available locally at my disposal. I use Obsidian as my only personal knowledge management system and everything I read, consume and study is on it available locally and synced to my iCloud.A snapshot of my Link RepositoryI’ve various notes in the newsletter section of my Second Brain (aka personal knowledge management system!) where I store links as and when I find them. The notes I use in my system are:\n Link Repository: This is where all interesting stories that I find go. All links are added at the top such that the latest ones are available at the top. I add a small text to identify the article followed by a link to it. This serves as the main source for curating content for my newsletter. Art Projects: Every art project I’ve come across goes into this section. Twitter Threads: Whenever I see an interesting Twitter thread, it goes in this note. Videos: When I watch an interesting video and I feel like it resonates with my audience, it is added here. Originals: Any original thought or an idea goes here so that I can refer it back at a later point in time for writing in my newsletter. Quotes: All interesting quotes that I read are added here. These are usually picked up from ReadWise. Misc: I also use some other notes for maintaining my newsletter. I also have a working document for the latest edition. a list of newsletter upgrades that I want to do in the future, a note track cross-promotion commitments and more.  As explained earlier, the process is simple. Every time I read something interesting, I copy the link and collect it on the corresponding note. Since Obsidian is synced to my iCloud I can use it on my laptop or on my phone.\nThe Process The whole process of curation to publishing is mentioned in the following sections:\nCuration The skeleton I use for drafting.I use Obsidian itself to draft my newsletter in markup language as I’m quite comfortable with it and is not distractive. I’ve got a skeleton template that I use to draft new editions every week. This follows the structure of my newsletter and allows me to add various content that is relevant for the upcoming edition from the link repository and other sources. By the weekend I would’ve finalized all the titles and content that I’m planning to send in the upcoming week. Once the sections are finalized and frozen, I start to write summaries on every section by researching more and verifying the credibility of the article or information, over the weekend or by Monday. I finish writing a draft of the newsletter in Obsidian.\nOnce I finish the draft, I finalise a title for the newsletter. Usually, I try to add some numbers in the title eg: 40 Concepts or 13 Maps as this results in the most engagement and the link opens. All links are added with a UTM tag suffix with my newsletter link. I finalize the title and add necessary tags such that related notes are linked in Obsidian.\nFormatting Editing on Hemingway editor. I try to achieve a readability score of 9 or less!Once the draft is ready, it is copied to Hemingway Editorfor readability and grammar check using the Grammarly Plugin. Hemingway editor ensures that sentences are not complicated and readability is okayish. I tweak some changes as per the recommendation by the service and make necessary changes to the grammar as per the recommendations by Grammarly. I also use WordTunefor finding synonyms or tweaking any particular sentence to make it simple.\nPublishing After all formatting, the content is copied and pasted to the Substack editor for final formatting. I add buttons with corresponding links, spacers between titles and headings with H2 size. I use an emoji plugin to add an emoji related to each title to make the newsletter more appealing to the eyes. I add the current edition number as a subheading with the place of publishing with the temperature and also an indication of weather with an emoji.\nOnce all formatting is done, I send a test edition to my own mailbox and cross-read it on my iPhone and laptop to cross-check for any errors or spelling mistakes. Once everything is aligned, the newsletter is scheduled to go out on 5.30 AM IST on Wednesdays! I’ve tweaked the timings and I found this best in terms of engagement considering the time zones of readers spanning across different continents.\nOnce the newsletter is published, usually after 7-8 hours I share the link on Reddit and Twitter for additional visibility.\nThe Grind The system explained in this blog post is one that I’ve tweaked and finalized over a year. What works for me might not work for you and it is important to find an ideal system that is frictionless. The system evolves over time as I study the engagement and analyze more data. Irrespective of the system in place, my life has changed after curating this newsletter. Even though drafting this takes close 4-5 hours every week, the newsletter is in making throughout the week. I try to publish the best version every week and there is no doubt that this newsletter has made 1% better every week if not every day!\nDo you have a newsletter? What system do you use? I’m curious to know more.\n","permalink":"https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/how-i-curate-my-newsletter/","summary":"The Structure Before I start explaining my process, it is important to discuss the structure of my newsletter.

My primary means of information consumption was through my laptop and I used my phone to consume content only while travelling or during unavoidable circumstances. Following are some steps, and tips that I followed in the Boring Phone framework such that I’m less addicted to my smartphone. I do not claim that following this made me completely free from smartphone addiction, but these steps clearly had an impact on my life. Any suggestions mentioned in the comments that are relevant to this framework will be added to this article with a mention.\n Try to use a smartphone with a smaller screen size. A smaller screen size means it’s harder to watch video content. I made a switch couple of months back from Oneplus to an iPhone 13 Mini which has a 5.4″ screen. I no longer watch very long content on my phone as the screen is too small! Ensure that there are no streaming apps on your smartphone. This includes Netflix, Youtube, etc. I even cancelled my Youtube Premium subscription as I found that ads actually prevent me from watching content for too long. Do not grant permission to send notifications for all apps. Only give notification access to apps that are extremely important like banking-related apps. Set your phone on silent mode or DND as much as possible. Turn off the notification sound on your smartphone. Uninstall all social media apps from your smartphone and access them only via the web using your laptop. Turn off all recommended and personalized suggestions across apps. If you’re using an iOS device, ask the app to not track your information. Do not browse Wikipedia on your smartphone browser. Make use of focus modes on your smartphone. If you’re working set your phone to work mode so that you’re undistracted. Even if your phone is slower, try not to upgrade as a faster phone can keep you addicted for longer periods of time. Do not install any games on your smartphone. Do not sleep or wake up with a phone next to your bed. Ensure that your phone is at least a few steps away from your bed. Do not use your smartphone on the toilet. I prefer reading newspapers or Kindlewhile using the toilet. Make a decision such that while you are consuming content on your smartphone, do it only while you’re sitting in a chair or standing, but not in your bed. Try not to use your smartphone at least 30 minutes before sleeping and after waking up. Set a boring wallpaper such that you do not have any visual cues to pick up your smartphone even to check the picture.

The genie gives you the wish that you determine the economic and social system into which you are going to emerge. There is a catch though as you do not have any control over where you would be born. If you play the lottery, you do not know whether you’re going to be:\n Born in India, Afghanistan, Somalia, UK, the USA or somewhere else. Born male, female or others. White, black, brown or any other ethnicity. Tall, short, average or a dwarf Intelligent, Average, or retarded Born to rich, poor or middle-class parents Aborted or die during the birth In school or forced to work in a cobalt mine for the corporations  According to Buffet, ideally, you want to create a system that is going to produce an abundant amount of goods which would increase at a rapid rate so that the future generations would have a better life. The system should incentivize the people who won the lottery but at the same time should ensure that the others who didn’t win the lottery have a decent life.\nWarren Buffet says, “When I was a kid, I got all kinds of good things. I had the advantage of a home where people talked about interesting things, and I had intelligent parents and I went to decent schools. I don’t think I could have been raised with a better pair of parents. That was enormously important. I didn’t get money from my parents, and I really didn’t want it. But I was born at the right time and place. I won the ‘Ovarian Lottery”\nBuffet was a special individual who was born into the right family at the right time. His dad, Howard Buffett, owned a small brokerage and this gave him a headstart to learning more about investing. Buffet points out the case of his 2 sisters who were equally smart and ambitious. However, in those times, there were very limited opportunities for women and they couldn’t achieve much. Thus, as a Caucasian male, it was easier for him to become a billionaire at that time, contrary to Oprah Winfrey who had a tough road becoming the first black billionaire.\nThe Gratitude Angle Warren BuffetAt the time of writing this article, the world population stands at somewhere around 7.9 billion. If you’re reading this article, irrespective of your geography or financial status, you’re in the top 60% of the population that has access to the internet.\nI feel like I’ve won the lottery. I was born in a developing economy as a male, I always had a roof over my head, I never faced any problem with access to food or water, I had opportunities for education and I’m lucky that I was not born in a time when there was a conflict or war.\nIf I’m guessing right, most people with a computer, freedom to access the internet, ability to speak some English and smart enough to reach this website would never take the Ovarian Lottery. We always complain about the shortcomings in our life but think about someone born now in Afghanistan or a refugee camp in Somalia? Someone like that would be up for a gamble and would definitely take the lottery!\nI also wonder about the randomness and the lack of control we have over our lives. Where we start in life has a tremendous effect on where we end up in life. This thought experiment gave me a sense of gratitude and I’ve never felt happy about my life like this in a while!\nI would love to hear your thoughts on the experiment. Would you take the lottery?

On the contrary, the smartphone is a multipurpose device that serves many functions. The problem with multipurpose devices like a smartphone is a distraction. Imagine you’re trying to read on your smartphone and suddenly you’re distracted by notification and the flow is lost. Even though there are many multipurpose devices in our lives, nothing has penetrated into our lives like a smartphone. As someone who grew up in a developing country with minimal access to technology, I can really see a shift from single-purpose devices to multi-purpose devices. The majority of these single-purpose devices were replaced with the introduction of smartphones. Some examples of real-life situations where single-purpose devices are replaced by a smartphone are below:\n 📞 Communication: My first mobile was a CDMA mobile by Reliance, whose sole purpose was only calling and messaging. With the advent of instant messaging services, SMS-based text messaging is very limited days. I do not wish to go back to the old days when I had to wait for 2 minutes for a reply, but when I had a basic phone, the sole purpose was only communication. Nowadays even while texting friends on Whatsapp, I multitask by switching windows and I’m less mindful. 📷 Camera: Mobile photography has boomed over the years and has made everyone a photographer these days. But have we lost the essence of photography and enjoying moments with smartphone cameras? If you go to any national monument or an epic landscape, the majority of people would be in a battle to capture the best shot for posting on social media. Has access to the camera altered the way we enjoyed moments? As a person who loves photography, I love those moments when I’m lost in the streets with my camera in a meditative state with nothing on my mind. I do not get the same feeling of shooting with a smartphone camera as I would be distracted easily by the notifications or some other thing on my smartphone. 🎧 Music: I remember the days when I used to travel on the bus solely listening to offline songs stored in my Sony Walkman. Gone are those days when music was the prime focus. I don’t know if it’s me but I’m usually distracted even when I’m listening to music as music plays in the background. Having a specific device for listening to music is a great idea for distraction-free enjoyment. 📚 Books: Have you ever tried reading a book on your smartphone? Even though reading books on a smartphone sounds accessible, many of us get distracted by notifications or are tempted to check other windows between reading. Having a book to read or a Kindle is a great alternative to this. Since Kindle is distraction-free as it has a minimal feature set, it is a great example of a single-purpose device. ⏰ Alarm: I’ve been thinking of getting an analogue alarm clock for a while now. Since I usually set my alarm on my smartphone, it is yet another excuse to keep my phone near my bed. There are times when I wake up in the middle of the night and end up checking my smartphone.  The Future of Single-Purpose Devices As we move into a future where everyone is concerned about their attention span, more single-purpose devices will pop up. In fact, I’ve been trying to make my phone boring these days to curb my addiction and be less dependent on it. Single-purpose devices like dumbphoneshave had increased sales in the last couple of years. Analogue alarmclocks are in demand across the world and people are even trying to find ways to write distraction-free using specialized distraction-free writers. A handful of companies are trying to market flip phones thanks to the rising demand. Companies like Apple have started to add focus modes on iPhones to make them distraction-free while working or reading. While Spotify is still popular, the market has seen a slight increase in the sales of vinyl records proving a market outside vinyl enthusiasts.\nWhat can you Do? Even though is easy to say to embrace single-purpose devices, it’s pretty hard considering the connected world we are living in. In my opinion, the only way to solve this problem is to slowly evolve from being dependent on smartphones to single-purpose devices. For example, while travelling try to put your phone on flight mode and try to take photographs with a DSLR or an old smartphone solely meant for photography. If the budget and space allow, set up an exclusive workstation or a device for writing. Minimize your smartphone usage while watching videos and try to consume video content on your laptop or PC. Try to read books using a physical copy or on a Kindle. By slowly allocating separate devices for separate purposes, we can be less dependent on our smartphones and preserve our attention.\n","permalink":"https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/single-purpose-devices/","summary":"Importance of Single Purpose Devices To start with, a single-purpose device is a device that serves only one purpose or function.

Over the years marketers have mastered various techniques that force consumers to impulse purchase products. Some techniques have evolved over time as in recent times there was a drastic shift in shopping patterns with the rising popularity of e-commerce sites. But underlying psychology remains the same and today every app that has something to sell is fighting for our attention, forcing us to buy stuff. Before going on to reduce impulse buying in life, it is important to understand the cues around us that are strategically deployed for impulse purchases :\n Apps make use of FOMO(Fear of missing out) to force consumers to make purchase decisions immediately. This is the reason often there are sale days, discounted prices and tags like ‘Limited Supply’ or ‘Only 1 remaining’. Same-day delivery often marketed by Amazon forces us to buy stuff at uncommon hours. Imagine you are searching for shoes at 2 AM in the morning and if Amazon shows that the shoes can be delivered the same day with a timer, the probability of instant ordering is higher. The Pay later schemes especially in India are getting quite popular. Pay Later lets us buy stuff without any hassle of entering card information or at a time when we don’t actually have money. Often product listings will have cues that will say, ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’, which forces us to buy products immediately. Imagine it’s noon and you are hungry. Suddenly UberEats or Zomato suddenly pings you with a notification with a deal price at your favourite restaurant. The right trigger at times when we are hungry often forces us to order food even though we never intended to. Add-on products or services offered at a discount price also used the FOMO strategy to force us to buy extra things that we do not require. I’m a great fan of ebooks, yet the convenience of ordering an ebook and getting it delivered instantly on my Kindle has caused me to order a lot of books that I didn’t even start. Recommended products are yet another tactic used by marketers to force us to look at products that we never intended to. The age-old tactics of keeping chocolates or gums at the checkout till are a classic example of impulse buying cues.  How to Stop Impulse Buying After being mindful and conscious about my purchases, here are some ways you can avoid impulse buying:\n Next time you feel like buying something online or offline, evaluate whether the product is a need or a want. Even if it’s a need or a want unless it’s an emergency, delay the shopping by 72 hours. Do not add the product to the wishlist on Amazon or any other app. After 72 hours, if you still remember about the product, evaluate the pros and cons, make a mental note of why you need the product and then make a purchase decision. Try not to buy anything online using a credit card or buy now pay later schemes. Disable app tracking and suggestions such that apps cannot provide you with a recommended set of products or services. Disable notifications of all apps that are not necessary like food delivery, grocery and other e-commerce apps to reduce external cues. Never fall for deals or discounts or sale days. Just because a sale is happening doesn’t mean that you have to purchase something.  Closing Thoughts Impulse buying doesn’t matter much if it is a candy or packet of gum. But I had serious problems in the past with impulse buying. Some weird stuff that I ordered but I never used are a belly fat calliper, fine liner pens, stacks of beautiful journals, a GoPro, a streaming card and more. A couple of weeks back I was browsing YouTube and saw a video of a famous productivity YouTuber talking about bullet journaling. I immediately opened Amazon and was so close to ordering a fancy bullet journal as well as some pens for journaling. But somehow I remembered about the 72-hour rule and I never thought of bullet journaling until now when I was writing this article. I think the key to controlling impulse purchases is to identify the external cues and be mindful of how we respond to them.\n","permalink":"https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/72-hour-rule/","summary":"The Triggers Let’s not blame marketers, it is their job to promote products and force us to buy.

The goal of zone 2 training is to sustain an intensity for longer periods of time such that heart rate lies in the range of 60-70% of the maximum heart rate value. Training at this intensity is incredibly easy and boring at the same time. When I started zone 2 training, I was a bit sceptical as it seemed too easy and I always had the attitude of ‘go hard or go home’ when it comes to training. Over time I realized this art of slowing down and how it can contribute to my aerobic fitness. In fact, the majority of high-performance endurance athletes follow the zone 2 training regime and it has proven benefits as per many scientific studies. The concept can be quite tricky to grasp as it’s hard to comprehend how training slow can help us to go faster. To understand it more, it is necessary to understand some science behind zone training and I’ve tried my best to summarise it in a concise fashion.\nScience of Zone 2 Training How an athlete performs depends upon his/her ability to convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. All cells in our body are fueled by something called Adenosine Triphosphate or ATP. Mitochondria in our cells generate ATP mainly in two ways – through aerobic or anaerobic mechanisms. The aerobic mechanism involves the conversion of fat into ATP whereas in the anaerobic mechanism carbohydrates are used. Also in our muscles, we have slow-twitch(Type 1) and fast-twitch muscles(Type 2). Type 1 muscles have a lot of mitochondria and prefer fat as fuel whereas Type 2 muscle fibres are glycolytic and prefer carbohydrates as fuel. Burning glucose or carbohydrates produces lactate and hydrogen ions, resulting in muscle fatigue.Source: Training PeaksBy training in Zone 2, we are mainly using Type 1 muscle fibres and making use of the fat deposits as a source of fuel. The lactate build-up will be limited at this zone and we can maintain our efforts for longer periods of time at this level. Training at this zone stimulates Type 1 muscle fibres, stimulating mitochondrial growth and improving our function to utilize fat in our body. We can preserve the glycogen in our body to utilize in the last courses of the race when we tend to run or move faster. As discussed earlier, utilizing Type 2 muscle fibres will result in the production of lactate. A transporter called MCT-4 present in Type 1 muscle fibres can transport this lactate to mitochondria for the generation of ATP. Thus Type 1 muscle fibres play a major role in lactate clearance as well.\nTo summarize, training in zone 2 will stimulate Type 1 muscle fibres, which will increase the mitochondrial density in our muscles. This in turn improves fat utilization and increases the lactate clearance in our muscle fibres, thereby increasing athletic performance.\nHow to Train Ideally, 80% of all training should be done in Zone 2 to improve endurance. The most common and easy way to train in Zone 2 is to monitor your heart rate. For this, you need some sort of heart rate monitoring device. I personally use Amazfit T-Rex Proas it is the only heart rate monitor I have access to. It is a good and affordable option and the results are 98% the same as that of an Apple Watch Series 7based on my test. If you have the budget, I would definitely recommend you invest in a good heart-rate chest strapor a better watch like Garmin Forerunner. Chest straps usually give more accurate results compared to wrist-based heart rate monitoring in smartwatches.\nThe first step is to determine your maximum heart rate. I personally use the maximum heart rate from the data of all workouts I have done. You can also involve in an activity like cycling or running such that you increase your pace every 2 minutes until you can sustain it. Your heart rate at this point will be your maximum heart rate. Or, you can use the traditional way of finding heart rate by subtracting your age from 220. (If your age is 25, the max heart rate will be 195 bpm).\nOnce you have a value for your maximum heart rate, a ballpark estimate of your zone 2 heart range will be 70-80% of your heart rate. So if your maximum heart rate is 195bpm, your zone 2 range will be 136-156bpm. There are a number of calculators available online that you can use to calculate your zone 2 range. I have seen many people recommending the MAF 180 Formula, which you can use to calculate your upper zone of zone 2.\nTraining in Zone 2 is simple yet hard at the same time. You can run, cycle or do any activity such that your heart rate falls between the range of your zone 2 heart rate levels. Say if you’re running and your heart rate goes above your upper limit, slow down or start walking to bring down your heart rate. This is quite hard as we all have this tendency to go hard and running slow when you start training at zone 2 is quite painful. My personal suggestion would be to start training in zone 2 by cycling as it is much easier to maintain zone 2 levels during cycling than compared to running. If your smartwatch allows, try to set up alerts on your smartwatch such that it alerts you when you fall out of the range. Ideally, 80% of all your training should be done in Zone 2.\nMy Experience so far As you can see, I still struggle!I do not have any miraculous experiences to share when it comes to zone 2 training as it’s been only a few months since I learnt about this training method and started doing it. I try to do 4 workouts a week in zone 2 and there are some changes I can notice. I feel very less fatigue and tiredness post workouts these days. After a few times of zone 2 training, every time I run I feel like I could go on forever. In fact, the first 10k I did was by accident. I initially planned to do a 5k run while maintaining my heart rate in zone 2 and once I completed I felt like I could go on forever. So I continued running and completed my first 10k run by surprise. I still struggle to train at Zone 2 as my heart rate keeps on crossing the range at times. When I started I couldn’t even keep my heart rate in zone 2 more than 30% of the time. As I’m writing today, I can easily keep my heart rate in zone 2 80% of the time during most workouts. I’m trying to improve day by day and will update this post once I see some tangible results.\n","permalink":"https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/zone-2-training/","summary":"In a nutshell, zone 2 training involves training at a low-intensity level for a longer period of time.

Create alternate work streams and a passive income by the end of 2022. Master programming and transition my career into a more data oriented one.  Objectives To achieve the goals mentioned in the previous section, the following objectives have been laid out. Some of these objectives are interconnected and contribute to more than one of the goals.\n🏋 Weight At the time of writing this post, my weight is 70 kgs, putting me in the slightly obese range on the BMI scale. I have shed close to 6kgs in the last month, but by end of 2022, I want to achieve a target weight of 65. I’m tracking this progress on Google Fit as well as on the Zepp app.\n🛌 Sleep Last year, I’ve done enough reading on the importance of sleep and it’s quite evident from the scientific literature that human beings need close 7-8 hours of sleep irrespective of what all hustle gurus say. Having a consistent sleep schedule is important as it balances the circadian rhythm. My plan is to sleep around 11 PM every night and wake up around 6 AM every day along with a 30 min nap in the afternoon. I would love to track my sleep, but what I’ve found is whenever I ever my fitness tracker to sleep, it’s quite uncomfortable for me to have something on my wrist while sleeping. This eventually affects my quality of sleep and I prefer not to do it. For the moment I’m tracking my sleep in my habit tracker on a google sheet! (I have a couple of ideas for developing an obstruction-free fitness tracker. If you’re someone who works in that space or would love to build one, do ping me!)\n🚴Cycling I rode around 3000kms in 2021 and 2022. I recently purchased a road bike and I’m planning to take cycling seriously this year. In 2022, I plan to ride a minimum of 6000 km. I love long-distance cycling/ randonneuring and I’m planning to compete for 200 and 300 BRMs this year. So far I’ve completed close 600+ km and I’m well on track. Follow me on Stravato see what I’m up to!\n🏃‍♂️ Running I’ve always wanted to run but never committed to it. So the plan this year is to start things slowly and attain a fitness level to participate in a half marathon event or do a virtual half marathon run by end of this year. At the time of writing, I’m able to run 5k easily and I’m working towards my endurance on running a 10k.\n🏊‍♂️ Swimming I learnt proper swimming end of last year and have decided to dedicate 2 days a week to swimming. I’m in the process of improving my form of swimming and my goal is to attain the fitness to swim continuously for 800m this year. Swimming is totally new for me, so I haven’t set anything ambitious here.. This training regime would allow me to gain some confidence in the open water swimming, a plan I have for 2023.\n🧘‍♂️Meditation As Naval has said, Meditation is the art of doing nothing. I’ve been using Waking Upby Sam Harris for meditating. Last year I logged close to 120 mindful days, accounting for a total of 2000+ minutes of meditation. The goal for 2022 is to move away from the app and start practising unguided meditation every day for 20 minutes.\n⏲ Fasting I’ve tried intermittent fasting during the second half of last year and it worked wonders for me. I love the concept of fasting and it gives me so much energy throughout the day. I love my current fasting schedule and would like to stick to the same this year ie 16/8 fasting with two 24 hours continuous fasting in a month. So this would come around 5840 hours, but considering some buffer, I’m hoping to hit a target of at least 4500 hours of fasting by EOY. Tracking the fasting hours is tricky and I’m thinking of developing an app that works with an NFC tag for friction-free fasting. The plan is that I’ll scan an NFC tag and it will automatically note the current time indicating the start or stop of fasting. Let’s see how it pans out.\n🍲 Diet I would like to cut on outside food more this year and preferably would love to eat from home the majority of the meals. After a lot of research on this front, my goal is to follow a diet that contains zero added sugar, more fibre, seasonal produce, fatty fish, lean meat, least processed, colourful (means more antioxidants) and fermented (Need to explore a bit of fermentation this year!). Also, another plan is to take a 60-day no sugar challenge in May 2022.\n🍺 Alcohol I’ve been drinking since 2013 and consider myself a social drinker. But the last couple of months, I’ve noticed that consuming alcohol had a drastic effect on my bowel and sleeping patterns. Even a single pint of beer would cause hangover issues for me the next day and I’ve started to hate drinking during the last couple of months. The goal for this year is to drink as little as possible with maximum hydration possible.\n💻 Programming I’ve always felt like I’ve missed the bus ride for programming. I’ve lived with that remorse over the year, but I’ve decided to stop complaining and master programming this year. With Web 3.0 coming, I don’t want to miss the train ride again. The goal for this year is to learn Python, master the basics of data science and transition into a career that is oriented towards data. At my current job I’m doing focused on energy, I deal with a lot of data and I’m in love with that. In 2023, if everything goes well, I plan to study again and do a postgraduate degree in data science. The plan is to complete the data science MOOC’s I’m doing by March 2022, and compete in some challenges on the Kaggle platform. By end of the year, I would like to create a portfolio that would help me in university admissions and job hunts.\nAnother goal for 2022 is to learn to code in Javascript and write smart contracts. With Web 3.0 coming, this is quite essential. As a first step towards it, I’m porting this blog into a fully custom static blog based on the eleventy framework. I’m midway through the project and I’m already dealing with a lot of javascript code. Moving the blog from WordPress into a static one will allow me to have more control over the blog and its performance.\n🎨 Art Art is something that adds purpose to my life. When I’m photographing or working on something artsy, I’m in a meditative state that I cannot explain. I created very little art in 2021, something I’m really sad about. I want to create more art in 2022. I’ve been part of a wonderful community of artists at Better Art Foundation, but I’ve never utilised my opportunities well. The goal for 2022 is to create more art and build a portfolio of a minimum of 3 art projects. The projects I’ve planned for 2022 are Abandoned Gods, Memoirs of an ALS Patient and an NFT Project. The NFT project is something that I’m really excited about and involves some generative art, which complements the programming goals I’ve for this year. 2023 will be the year when I will focus more of my attention on generative art using AI.\n📰 Newsletter My newsletter 10+1 Thingsexceeded my expectations and crossed 700 subs in 2021. I’m taking a break from writing the newsletter in January, but plan to restart it in February. The goal for 2022 is to hit 2000 subscribers by end of the year. The newsletter is a key part of my journey as it documents my learning, but also provides an audience for discovery. Moreover, I’m happy to create a community of like-minded individuals through the newsletter. I’m looking for cross-promotion opportunities heavily this year to achieve my goal, so if you’re someone who is writing a newsletter, feel free to ping me.\n✍️ Blogging I would love to write more articles on this blog this year. As I’m writing this I have got a list of 75+ ideas that are worth exploring. I’m aiming to finish 2022 by publishing a minimum of 30 original blog posts. Also, a lot of sections on this blog are not updated, something I’m working on. All these will be hosted on my blog that will be custom coded by end of this year.\n📚 Reading I set an ambitious target of 52 books for 2021 even though I started late in June 2021. I failed to meet the target and eventually ended 2021 with 33 books. This year I’m planning to read consistently and aim to read a minimum of 45 books by EOY.\n🎓 Theoretical Physics and Interaction Design Apart from programming and other passions, I’m also pursuing theoretical physics and interaction design passively. For interaction design, I’m taking the lessons from Interaction Design Foundationand for Theoretical Physics I’m learning from the modules from Theoretical Minimumand Good Theorist.The goal for 2022 is to complete classical mechanicsin theoretical physics and Become a UX Designer from Scratch on IDF. \n💸 Side Hustles I’m earning a bit from the newsletter, but it’s not really much to support me as a creator. By end of the year, I plan to generate a minimum of 50000 INR (~ $670) per month from the side hustles. The primary income streams would be from sponsorships from 10+1 Things, freelancing on Fiverr and a course/product I’m creating for newsletter writers.\n💰 Emergency Fund One of the biggest mistakes of 2021 was travelling irresponsibly without thinking about an emergency fund. Emergency funds are critical and give everyone a cushion when an unexpected situation appears. I aim to create an emergency fund by end of this year that will support me for at least 6 months in case of an emergency.\n💰 Portfolio Risk Management I started investing even before I had an emergency fund which is a blunder because of FOMO. Also as I’m writing this 35% of my portfolio is in Cryptocurrency which is a huge risk considering the taxation the Indian government is imposing. I would like to minimize my crypto investments to 20% of my portfolio and allocate more debt instruments into my portfolio to reduce risks. Ideally, I want my portfolio to be 30% Indian and US equities, 40% debt/ index funds, 20% crypto and 10% as cash.\n💭 Other Objectives Apart from these main objectives, some other objectives are to increase my earning potential, relocate to Europe with my partner and create a lifestyle that is sustainable in the long run. But these are all interconnected and I don’t really have a clear picture of those at the time of writing this article. For example, if I achieve my career goals in programming and blogging, I would definitely have a higher income potential, which will open up opportunities to relocate to anywhere in Europe.\nContrary to the last couple of years, I plan to travel very less this year. Considering the financial, health and career goals I have set for this year, it would be very unsustainable to travel for long this year. and hence it never made the list of goals this year. The only travel I would be doing this year will be to Dubai, where my partner is located and a couple of local treks in Kerala, India where I’m currently based in.\nAnother goal or project I’ve in my mind is to set up a business for my mother ( ideally related to food), something that will keep her engaged. I also would love to improve the front yard garden we have and build a small vegetable garden for seasonal vegetables. At the time of writing, I’m in process of setting up a drip irrigation system for watering and a herbal garden. But these are projects that are very low on my priority list and something I do to take my mind off from my usual routine. Let’s see how it pans out in 2022.\nFinal Thoughts A wise man once said to me that you should always have a plan irrespective of the timeline or date. I may or may not achieve these goals by end of 2022. But what this plan gives me is a perspective for the whole year and some focus on things I need to work on, End of 2022, I will update you on the status of all these objectives I’ve with a year-end review. I’ve tried to kept this plan as realistic as possible, but due to the fascinating brains we have, I may have overestimated the things I can achieve in 12 months. Contrary to the popular notion to focus on one thing, I love to work on multiple things in parallel. This can be inefficient at times, but according to me, the magic happens at the intersection of these wild pursuits. I thrive on those aha moments and can’t wait to experience them!\n","permalink":"https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/2022-planning/","summary":"Goals  To be fit and healthy by end of 2022.

Learning doesn’t end in school and is a lifelong process. Self-learning is key in the 21st century. Programming or Coding is an essential skill that needs to be learnt. I regret not learning it, but I’m in the process to master it. Excel is the most wonderful software in the world. I had underestimated or hated Excel till 2019 and thought of it more as accounting software. When I started using Excel at work, I realized how amazing it is and its applications in various fields. I never paid much attention to Economics all my life and thought of it as a boring subject. But during my postgraduate studies, I attended one of the lectures on the economics of renewable energy and I fell in love with economics. In fact, I’m slowly reading Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith in my free time! Statistics is not bullshit and is very important in terms of career and understanding trends in data. Yet another mistake I did was to never pay attention to statistics and now I regret it. I’m learning statistics now as I’m trying to transition into a more data-oriented career path. Humans are wired to think linearly and it’s hard for us to visualize exponential growth. There is no secret formula for weight loss. Track your calories and make sure that calorie-in must be always than calorie-out. Tried this for 4 months consistently and I lost 7 kgs. I was always too reluctant to change or update my belief systems. Over time I realized that there is no harm or problem in changing your life philosophies or beliefs. Successful people are those who question and change their beliefs quite often. Just like any other skill, reading is a skill to learn. Active reading is key for remembering ideas and applying those to your life. No matter how great or revolutionary your ideas are, execution matters the most. Never compare yourself with others. Would you swap your life with the person you’re comparing with? There should be a purpose for every trip or travel you do. For me personally, I would love to learn a new skill or something from every place I visit. Never put too many spices in any food. Even though Indian food is quite famous around the world, in the majority of the dishes, the spices overpower the protein. In my opinion, fish should taste like fish and not spices. People come and go in life. Death is inevitable and is not something to be concerned about. We are all destined to Observe and learn from everyone. Everybody is unique and there is always something to learn, no matter how toxic they are. Limit your digital time and make sure you’re spending time on digital devices mindfully. Plan and start an attention diet on the information you consume. Stop looking for inspirations or examples all the time. Nobody would have done what you want to achieve and it doesn’t mean that you cannot do it. You’re not an impostor. Impostor syndrome is common and everybody who has put something out in the public would have suffered from it. Learn to overcome it. Algorithms are designed to keep you addicted and are smarter than you think. Never fall for its trap. Make sure you clear your cookies, reset your search history and make sure that the algorithm doesn’t know you well. Never create art with an audience in mind. Create the art for your own joy and pride. The audience will eventually find it and if your art is good enough, it will survive generations. Sugar is toxic for your body. In nature, sugar doesn’t exist at the scale we are having. A hunter-gatherer or forager would never have access to sugar as much we have now. Our bodies are not designed to handle sugar overdose If relationships turn out to be toxic, let go of them. It doesn’t matter how close you are/were, but if it’s toxic, there is no point in continuing it be it, friends or family. There is a lot of misinformation or pseudoscience out there. Be it hormone-free chickens, Ayurvedaor MSG fear. You don’t have to read or follow the newsas most of it is irrelevant.

Subway is popular because it gives people the feeling that they are making their own sandwich and it allows for customization. People are ready to pay a premium for apple plucking even though the actual cost of apples are less. Many distilleries and breweries have factory tours that allow customers to make their own beer or whisky and charge a hefty amount for it. Haycations are popular in some parts of the world where people come and harvest the produce from the farm itself during holidays. Kids tend to like and eat more vegetables if they are involved in the cooking process. From shoes to toys, often manufacturers allow some sort of customization so that the IKEA effect takes over and results in more sales. In some animals such as rats and starlings, prefer to eat food from sources that required effort on their part.  In the study, a series of experiments were conducted by the researchers among a group who have split it into groups. I read the paper and have tried to distil down the results below:\nIn the first experiment, participants were split into builders and non-builders. Builders were asked to assemble an IKEA storage box themselves using the instructions. The non-builders were simply told to inspect an already assembled similar storage box. After this, the participants were told to bid a price for the product. The builder’s group valued the product more than the non-builders, even though the product was the same.\nIn the second experiment, builders were asked to make an origami frog or crane using instructions. Builders were asked to bid a price at which they would buy back these origami creations. The non-builders were told to bid a price on these creations by builders and also the origami creations by professionals. The results indicated that the builder’s bid for their own creations was high as they wanted to avoid losing their creation. Builders bid was close to the price that was bid by non-builders for expert origami creations.\nIn another experiment, the group was split into builders and incomplete builders. The builders were allowed to assemble an IKEA product but incomplete builders were not allowed to complete the assembly even though they had all the pieces. As expected, the bid prices of builders were significantly higher than that of the incomplete builders.\nThese all results indicated the magnitude and extent to which the IKEA effect can influence our decisions. If you’re interested you can read the detailed study here.\nI’m new to this concept and this post is a working document. I’ll update more information as I discover more examples of the IKEA effect. Nevertheless, it is an excellent cognitive bias that can be used by marketers and engineers to craft products that sell organically with the help of this bias.\n","permalink":"https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/ikea-effect/","summary":"Source: Sketchplanations When instant cake mixes were introduced in the 1950s to simplify life, American housewife was reluctant to buy them.

Children were told the story about someone who was really smart and was asked to pick the story’s subject from a collection of pictures of men and women. 5-year-olds showed a lot of pride and chose the same gender. However, the results from 6 and 7 year-olds were quite shocking. According to the results, girls of these age groups did not associate being smart with their group (females), but boys continued to do so. When boys and girls grow up, girls often associate being smart with something that boys do.

An Attention Diet is to be followed in the 21st century, an era where we are bombarded with information. Attention diet focuseson the amount of media, content and socializing people are doing these days, eventually distracting themselves. The goal of an attention diet is to find highly nutritious sources of information and relationships to build our lives around them. The diet gives more importance to quality over quantity.\nAccording to Manson, the Attention diet is all about prioritizing nutritious sources of information and relationships over junk ones. Nutritious information is reliable, long-form and deep engaging information, whereas junk information is unreliable, short, addictive and emotionally charged. Nutritious relationships are people or groups who make you feel better, that are positive and help you grow. Junk relationships are often people or groups having little mutual trust, consistently making you feel worse about yourself or the world.\nWhy does it Matter? It all boils down to the question, why does it matter? Why should we follow an Attention Diet? Attention Diet is essential so that we can weed out all the unwanted crap in the information universe and focus on what is important ( I have written a piece on the importance of curated content in this context!). With the number of options we have, we are always distracted. Our attention span is very short and we cannot focus on anything for long. We are addicted to clickbaity titles and consume media more than ever before. Smartphones and Social media are often called cigarettes for millennial’s. According to Manson, you only grow in this world by your ability to correctly focus on less. In the same way, we tackled junk food and lifestyle diseases through nutritional diets in the 20th century, we need to improve our focuses through the attention diet.\nHow to Start an Attention Diet? The concept of the Attention Diet is similar to a nutritional diet where you cut down on unwanted food and eat more healthy to balance your macros and micros. In an Attention Diet, you mindfully limit the number of distractions you have, prioritize nutritious sources of information and relationships and eventually reduce your craving for junks sources of information and relationships.\nThree steps to follow in an attention diet are:\n Identify nutritious sources of information and relationships. Weed out all junk sources of information and connections. Cultivate the habit of deep focus and longer attention span.  From May 2021, I’ve been trying to adopt a lifestyle where I’m conscious about the information I’ve been consuming. I’ve been following the steps mentioned below in my attention diet. I do not claim that these would work for you, but it has definitely worked for me as I have better focus and more attention span within a short span of 3-4 months. This is a working article and I would upload more action items as soon as I discover them.\nReduce Social Media I’ve been annoyed with the bullshit content present in social media channels like Instagram, Youtube and Facebook. In April I unfollowed everyone on Instagram and unsubscribed from every Youtube channel. I do not have any social media apps on my phone now. The only social media platforms I use are Twitter and Reddit, which I have better control over what I’m consuming.\nUnfollow News and Media Outlets I do not follow any news or media outlets anymore. I have removed all the news and media apps from my phone. I had this habit of checking the news a few times in an hour, and this eliminated that habit.\nTurn off Personalised Suggestions By tracking our search results, Google makes sure that we have some content available for us to consume 24×7. I see very less relevant ads and recommendations after taking the step of turning of recommendations and personalised results.\nTry to consume long content I consume long forms of content like books, podcasts, well-researched articles and documentaries. I take notes while reading books or articles. Long-form content usually is better researched and has less BS with a better attention span.\nMute all notifications All notifications are muted on my phone except the call notifications during work hours.\nFind Sources of Accurate meaningful information The majority of the information I consume is through newsletters these days. For publications, bloggers or writers who are trustworthy, I usually subscribe to their newsletters so that I can consume information through my email. Other than this, I research a lot using Wikipedia. Any content outside is only consumed when I’m researching a particular topic, like writing this blog post.\nTime Blocking I use the technique of time blocking for reading emails, social media or for entertainment. I try to spend no more than 1.5 hours per day reading emails. I limit social media platforms I use like Reddit and Twitter to a maximum of 30 minutes a day. Entertainment like Music, YouTube usually accounts for a maximum of 1 hour per day. Rest of the time I spend usually reading books, building stuff or learning something.\nNo- Distraction Time I usually have these phases of no-distraction throughout the day. For example, when I’m writing an article or learning something, I usually turn on the Zen Mode on, my phone. This makes sure that I cannot use my phone in this period of time. Also on Sundays, I try to avoid smartphone use as long as possible. Outside office hours my phone is usually set to Airplane mode so that I’m not distracted by unnecessary calls or messages.\nSet Phone display to Monochrome Smartphones usually have an option to set the colours in your display. I use a OnePlus handset and it allows me to set the display colour as Monochrome. My phone is usually set to this and my phone display is less appealing due to this reason.\n","permalink":"https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/attention-diet/","summary":"Mark MansonWhat is an Attention Diet?

How an entry looks in Resonance JournalThe concept is simple. Every time you come across a video, podcast, job, article, book, project, etc that resonates with you, add it as an entry to the resonance journal. Use the existing tags or create one if it doesn’t exist. Over time you would see a pattern or a common thread of things that resonates with you. You would eventually see that some items often resonate with you and have multiple entries in the journal. For example, I came across articles, blogs, personalities around human-centred Design a lot in my journal. It was really interesting as there were very few entries related to renewable energy, my major in the journal! 🙂\nSelf-Discovery using Resonance Journal I have always struggled with what I wanted to do in life. I have always wanted to work on something I’m really passionate about especially in terms of career as it occupies a major part of your life. Journaling about things that resonates with me had a positive effect on my self-discovery journey. I realized that things that I thought mattered to me or stuff that I thought fitted me are not the ones I have a true connection with. Through this process, I found interesting patterns and came across multiple personalities again and again in different contexts. In fact, at the time of writing this, I’m currently doing a program on Design Research by the Interaction Design Foundation (IDF). This is something I have discovered after journaling for a few months on the resonance journal. I came across multiple instances where I felt a deep connection with design research like works by IDEO, Acumen Academy, Space10, Don Norman, etc. Every time I read about something related to UX say design research or interaction design, I feel a true connection and I’m very excited to know more about it. The funny thing is these were the same things that made me excited 2 years back, and I thought of it as another curiosity craving. I don’t know where this is right or wrong, but I’m happy that I’m pursuing something that resonates with me rather than doing something accidentally.\nYou can check out my sample resonance journal using the link below.\nWhat do you think of Resonance Journaling?

Things have changed a lot and now I have created a process to optimize the workflow. But I think the reason this newsletter has reached so far is that I decided to just start and forget about tweaking small things.\nImpostor Syndrome Impostor Syndromeis an internal experience of believing that you are not as competent as others perceive you to be. I always had problems with Impostor syndrome and always had the fear of not being good enough. This was one reason which held me back to start bloggingor a newsletter. Even though I overcame it by publishing the first edition, I was reluctant to share it with the public. I was worried that I won’t be good enough and I would eventually drop this eventually by not being consistent. Only after I published my 2nd edition, I started to share the newsletter with friends and with the public. One quote by Derek Siver‘s on his book Anything you Wanthas helped me a lot in this matter and it says: “What’s obvious to you is amazing to others.“. Also, the book Show Your Work by Austin Kleon helped me a lot in overcoming this fear. To everyone who is reading this, my advice would be to just start and forget about others.\nCommunity Matters When it comes to newsletters, community matters a lot. I was lucky enough to get good support from my close friends which encouraged me to continue this journey. Also, Substack has a great community of writers who unite every Thursday for Writer hourshelping each other. This feeling of community has benefitted me a lot. In terms of numbers, I have done 3-4 cross-promotions with other newsletter writers, which helped me to grow the subscriber base. I also have a close-knit group of newsletter creators whom I connect often for advice and support, and this has contributed a lot to this newsletter’s growth.\nDeveloping a process Since 10+1 Thingsis a newsletter that features curated content, it involves a lot of effort and time. Over time I have created a process that helps me to identify, collect and sort important snippets of information that I plan to be featured. Newsletter writing has become a part of my routine and it inspires me to read and learn throughout the week. Because of the routine, I’m more mindful of consuming information and weed out any unwanted distractions.

The more processed, longer shelf life products are less nutritious. Any food which contains added sugar is harmful to health.- Eat whole foods and try to avoid liquid food as much as possible. Humans are one among the few mammals who consume calories via liquid foods after weaning.  Favorite Quotes from the book  The healthiest food in the supermarket—the fresh produce—doesn’t boast about its healthfulness, because the growers don’t have the budget or the packaging. French paradox: the mystery (at least to nutritionists) of a population that eats all sorts of supposedly lethal fatty foods, and washes them down with red wine, but which is nevertheless healthier, slimmer, and slightly longer lived than we are. The whiter the bread, the sooner you’ll be dead.  Highlights from Kindle  Populations that eat a so-called Western diet—generally defined as a diet consisting of lots of processed foods and meat, lots of added fat and sugar, lots of refined grains, lots of everything except vegetables, fruits, and whole grains—invariably suffer from high rates of the so-called Western diseases: obesity, type diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food. Today foods are processed in ways specifically designed to get us to buy and eat more by pushing our evolutionary buttons—our inborn preferences for sweetness and fat and salt. These tastes are difficult to find in nature but cheap and easy for the food scientist to deploy, Avoid food products containing ingredients that no ordinary human would keep in the pantry. Avoid food products that contain high-fructose corn syrup. Avoid foods that have some form of sugar (or sweetener) listed among the top three ingredients. The healthiest food in the supermarket—the fresh produce—doesn’t boast about its healthfulness, because the growers don’t have the budget or the packaging. The more processed a food is, the longer the shelf life, and the less nutritious it typically is. Real food is alive—and therefore it should eventually die. Eat foods made from ingredients that you can picture in their raw state or growing in nature. If it came from a plant, eat it; if it was made in a plant, don’t. Also, by eating a diet that is primarily plant based, you’ll be consuming far fewer calories, since plant foods—with the exception of seeds, including grains and nuts—are typically less “energy dense” than the other things you eat. Vegetarians are notably healthier than carnivores, and they live longer. “Eating what stands on one leg (mushrooms and plant foods) is better than eating what stands on two legs (fowl), which is better than eating what stands on four legs (cows, pigs, and other mammals.” The colors of many vegetables reflect the different antioxidant phytochemicals they contain—anthocyanins, polyphenols, flavonoids, carotenoids. Many of these chemicals help protect against chronic diseases, but each in a slightly different way, so the best protection comes from a diet containing as many different phytochemicals as possible. Eat animals that have themselves eaten well. The dazzling diversity of food products on offer in the supermarket is deceptive, because so many of them are made from the same small handful of plant species, and most of those—the corn and soy and wheat—are seeds rather than leaves. The fields and forests are crowded with plants containing higher levels of various phytochemicals than their domesticated cousins. Why? Because these plants have to defend themselves against pests and diseases without any help from us, and because historically we’ve tended to select and breed crop plants for sweetness; many of the defensive compounds plants produce are bitter. We also breed for shelf life, and so have unwittingly selected for plants with low levels of omega- fatty acids, since these fats quickly oxidize—turn rancid. Humans are one of the very few mammals that obtain calories from liquids after weaning. “The whiter the bread, the sooner you’ll be dead.” People who eat lots of whole grains tend to be healthier and to live longer. Cultures that took corn from Latin America without the beans or the lime wound up with serious nutritional deficiencies such as pellagra. French paradox: the mystery (at least to nutritionists) of a population that eats all sorts of supposedly lethal fatty foods, and washes them down with red wine, but which is nevertheless healthier, slimmer, and slightly longer lived than we are. The American food system has for many years devoted its energies to increasing quantity and reducing price rather than to improving quality. As the cost of food in America has declined, in terms of both price and the effort required to put it on the table, we have been eating much more (and spending more on health care). Eat when you are hungry, not when you are bored. If you are going to snack, try to limit yourself to fruits, vegetables, and nuts.

I tried multiple apps like Calm, Headspacebut nothing worked for me. I discovered an app called Waking Upby Sam Harris, after reading his book Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion. Even though I’m having mixed thoughts towards the idea of new atheismand the ideas in his books, I decided to give the app a try.Source: Minimal Shades | TwitterThe plan was to try the 28-day introductory course in the app and 2 daily meditations for a total of 30 days and then see how it goes. I started the challenge on the 15th of May 2021 and decided to scribble my thoughts every day in a journal. These 30 days were amazing for me and opened up new perspectives. I could see changes in my everyday life due to this 10 – 20 min spent every day. I’m now comfortable in doing my own style of meditation and defining my own process. At times, I use the daily meditation option in the Waking Up app, but most days it’s just me sitting quietly listening to my mind. Meditation is now a part of my routine just like working out. Based on my experience I have penned down my own conclusions and observations on Meditation below:\nMeditation is not Spiritual but Fasting for the mind. As Naval has said, Meditation is the art of doing nothing. It is nothing but switching off your mind. While meditating you cut off from the outside noise and focus just on yourself. You don’t need gurus or chakras or buddhas or kundalinis or anything bogus to do meditation. It is good to have an app like Waking Up to get started, but if you have a strong desire to start, you can start by focusing on yourself. The whole idea of meditation takes us into altered states of consciousness doesn’t make sense to me. I felt relaxed and calm after meditation, that doesn’t mean anything spiritual. I feel the same trance when I’m involved in something I like. I felt the same while I was photographing dogs in the alleys of Varanasi or doing gardening at home. I feel the same when I go for a hike in nature and I’m lost in my own mind.\nMeditation is a skill Just like any other skill you are trying to learn, it takes consistent practice to get comfortable with meditation. It is more like exercising a muscle you have never worked out before. It takes time to calm your mind and do nothing. Doing a 60 min meditation is easier than doing a 30 min meditation as it takes some time to get rid of thoughts in your mind. Meditation is not something you do for a challenge or do seasonally. It is something to be practised at least for 30 minutes daily as part of your routine. Since it’s a skill to learn, it’s better to start with guided meditation using an app or video. Once you feel that you’re comfortable, experiment with the process and define your own style of meditation.\nBeing Mindful I have realized that I’m more mindful after I started doing meditation. I have these self pause moments throughout the day before speaking or analyzing things. I often think about why I’m doing a particular activity before starting it. I have started to notice the small things in my backyard, like the spider web behind my house or the crazy moss patterns on the wall. Being mindful throughout the day has been the most positive impact by practising meditation to me. I enjoy the small pauses of self-reflection and often wonder why I’m engaging in some actions. When it comes to photography, I believe I have a better eye for photography now. I can see crazy abstract patterns or stories or ideas which I never noticed before in everyday life. In fact, last day I was thinking of doing a project on Rust after seeing the rust pieces of metal around the home. I even spent some time looking at the patterns of rust in different objects.\nIt’s all about You There is no good or bad method. It’s not about reciting mantras or focusing on the breath. It is a form of self-examination where you explore yourself sitting quietly without any disturbance. There is no perfect style of meditation. It’s all about discovering what works for you. What I do is I start with a focus on breath and let my mind do nothing. I let the mind wander and do nothing. I don’t resist or reject anything, I just let my mind choose the trail. I often feel grateful for the things I have in life during these sessions.\nThe Science As per my research, there is no solid scientific proof of the benefits of meditation. There have been some studies in controlled study groups which has shown some positive results. But results were not conclusive and was no better than existing treatments. I’m in no position to comment about the science of meditation. For me, it’s more like a way of calming things down and start the day fresh. You can read more about the science of meditation here. Also, I happen to read an article on how mindfulness caused nervous breakdown for a practising meditator. If you’re interested, check out 10+1 Things: A weekly newsletter finely curated by me featuring 11 interesting things to feature your curiosity.\nCheck out the Archive The Journal As I had mentioned earlier, meditation is all about you. When I did the 30-Day Meditation Challenge, I decided to keep a small journal of my notes every day after meditating. I wrote these while doing the Introductory course in the Waking Up app. The thoughts are random, doesn’t make sense and are never to be followed. Ignore all the advice on the internet about meditation, including this article. It’s all about you and you have to discover it.\n**#1\n** Tried focusing on the visual field with closed eyes. Patterns were unique and very realistic. In some patterns, I could see so many details. There were moments where I got lost in thoughts but I came back. I feel like I’m good at visualizing?\n**#2\n** Noticed thoughts. Went to the root of those thoughts. Tried observing the visual field behind the eyes. Tried to look at the subject which was looking. Also tried observing the head which was looking with open eyes.\n**#3\n** Tried to understand that the visual field, thoughts, sensations all happen in consciousness. Tried to look for the head which was watching. Also explored the concept of where is consciousness.\n**#4\n** Tried exploring how I could make the present moment better. I realized that my mind was restless and explored the root cause of it.\n**#5\n** Concentrating breath has become easy. I look forward to meditating every day. I’m trying to find the route cause of the thought. Still cannot find the space plain of consciousness. Thought: My mind also has an impact on others.\n**#6\n** Breath concentration improved. Not bothered by sounds. But still getting lost in thoughts. Trying to be more mindful throughout the day. I can see small changes in my life. Trying to pay attention to thought\n**#7\n** Tried to concentrate on the thought/uneasiness/feeling. It’s hard but doable. Explored the root causes behind jealousy and self-doubt. Some stress or uneasiness in the back of my head felt better after the session. Thought: Trying to feel where the emotion is.\n**#8\n** Started Mental Noting: Counting breaths. Could do up to 60. Less distracted today. More relaxed. Thoughts are occurring less. Less bothered by the distractions around. Need to work on relaxing a bit more while counting.\n**#9\n** Sensations of body and sound felt like they occurred in the same space. Outside noise doesn’t matter anymore. Felt an elevated feeling when everything was in the same space. Mental note: Breath counting has become much effortless and can do up to 150+. Every day I’m looking forward to meditating.\n**#10\n** Feeling a bit stressed. I realized it is at the top head may be due to mediation. Outside noise doesn’t bother me at all. Maybe I’ll try to do it again today. Thought: The thought of getting disturbed itself is a sensation.\n**#11\n** Feeling more light. Light/Vision as consciousness was a bit difficult to grasp. But feeling a head high. Felt much lighter today. Could imagine a smoothie bottle with lemonade and straw. It felt so real that I even moved the lip to check whether the straw was there\n**#12\n** Feeling again light. Amazed by the thought experiment. Introduced a good and bad thought. Observed them. Paid attention to them. Couldn’t really distinguish them but felt different. But they were really a sensation in consciousness. It was really some energy in the body.\n**#13\n** Feeling a bit restless due to multiple thoughts in my head. Should have done meditation early. Could easily observe the breath. Could follow thoughts a bit as well. Planning to do another session today to bring more clarity.\n**#14\n** Challenging day. Hard trouble concentrating. Slightly understood the difference between attention and consciousness\n**#15\n** Getting much relaxed. Introduced mood today. Sounds and sensation were all in consciousness or space\n**#16\n** Very very relaxed. Trying to focus on the root cause of thoughts. Easily lost in the trance.\n**#17\n** Tried the exercise for feeling inside the head. Opened and closed my eyes to realize that everything happens in the same space. Still in search of the feeling of I.\n**#18\n** Trouble concentrating with eyes open. I can trackback to the feeling of body sensations and thoughts. I prefer focusing on my breath.\n**#19\n** Tried Meta Meditation today. Felt happy about her. Happy about other people’s achievements. The well-wishing had a profound effect on my consciousness.\n**#20\n** Tried to focus on an unpleasant thought which was bothering me and caused a head weight. Weirdly it vanished away when I paid attention.\n**#21\n** Gazed into the vastness of space behind eyelids. Forced a thought and an object into the consciousness. Couldn’t control the thoughts, but they come and go.\n**#22\n** Observed thoughts, sensations in mind. Head still disturbed due to some other reasons. Might try 30 min meditation. Reiterated on the purpose of doing it.\n**#23\n** Meditation is affecting my life positively. Explored the sense of myself/I today\n**#24\n** Tried to introduce unpleasant emotions into the meditation. But weird but felt okay.\n**#25\n** Introduced again a negative emotion. Felt the root cause of it.\n**#26\n** Introduced a smile into consciousness. Tried to be mindful when I felt restless. I was having huge mental friction to call someone and wish them but decided to call them after the session and wish. Mindful of how I love people around me. I texted few people I have been avoiding after the session. Feels positive.\n**#27\n** Introduced Subject-Object exercise. Tried to observe the subject itself while meditating on the snap of a finger. Found it hard to observe the self.\n**#28\n** Pause before doing things. Tried investigating thoughts, why it happened. It’s not about avoiding thoughts but being aware of them\n#29\nFocused on the breath. Felt more peaceful. The goal of meditation is not to become a good meditator. The goal is to explore the moment which was always there.\n**#30\n** Reached a point where I prefer doing my own meditation without the time constraint. I was lost in nothing and was interrupted by the end of 20 min meditation narration. Maybe I should try myself.\n","permalink":"https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/lessons-30-day-meditation-challenge/","summary":"Amir MotlaghI had struggled with a bit of anxiety and restlessness ever since I quit my job last year.

Usually, I open a random page on the book and read his ideas to get a fresh perspective.\nKey Notes  Happiness is a skill to develop and a choice we make. Something out there once achieved will make us happy is a delusion. It is a choice we make and can be controlled. The state of happiness is reached when you’re happy with what you have. Sugar + Fat is a deathly combination and doesn’t occur naturally in whole foods. The Power of Leverage  Favorite Quotes from the book Highlights from Kindle  Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity— a piece of a business— to gain your financial freedom. Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable. Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned. Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most. “All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.” Intentions don’t matter. Actions do. That’s why being ethical is hard. An old boss once warned: “You’ll never be rich since you’re obviously smart, and someone will always offer you a job that’s just good enough.” If someone is talking a lot about how honest they are, they’re probably dishonest. I think the smartest people can explain things to a child. The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. The number one thing clouding us from being able to see reality is we have preconceived notions of the way it should be. Facebook redesigns. Twitter redesigns. Personalities, careers, and teams also need redesigns. The moment you tell somebody something dishonest, you’ve lied to yourself. Happiness is the state when nothing is missing. If I say I’m happy, that means I was sad at some point. It’s about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. You’re born, you have a whole set of sensory experiences and stimulations (lights, colors, and sounds), and then you die. Happiness is what’s there when you remove the sense that something is missing in your life. The fundamental delusion: There is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever. Happiness is being satisfied with what you have. You can get almost anything you want out of life, as long as it’s one thing and you want it far more than anything else. You’re born alone. You’re going to die alone. All of your interpretations are alone. All your memories are alone. Do you want to be the world’s best lover and known as the worst, or the world’s worst lover and known as the best? One day, I realized with all these people I was jealous of, I couldn’t just choose little aspects of their life. If you’re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/ 7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous. Once I came to that realization, jealousy faded away because I don’t want to be anybody else. I’m perfectly happy being me. When it comes to medicines for the mind, the placebo effect is 100 percent effective. At the end of the day, you are a combination of your habits and the people who you spend the most time with. Many distinctions between people who get happier as they get older and people who don’t can be explained by what habits they have developed. We should be two monkeys sitting in the jungle right now watching the sun going down, asking ourselves where we are going to sleep. The most important trick to being happy is to realize happiness is a skill you develop and a choice you make. It’s the news’ job to make you anxious and angry. But its underlying scientific, economic, education, and conflict trends are positive. Stay optimistic. “What is the positive of this situation?” Fundamentally, it boils down to one big hack: embracing death. Death is the most important thing that is ever going to happen to you. Certainly, listen and absorb, but don’t try to emulate. The combinatorics of human DNA and experience are staggering. You will never meet any two humans who are substitutable for each other. Nothing like a health problem to turn up the contrast dial for the rest of life. Outside of math, physics, and chemistry, there isn’t much “settled science.” If you eat a fatty meal and you throw some sugar in, the sugar is going to deliver hunger and fat is going to deliver the calories and you’re just going to binge. Why all desserts are large combinations of fat and carbs together. In nature, it’s very rare to find carbs and fat together. The combination of sugar and fat together is really deadly. World’s simplest diet: The more processed the food, the less one should consume. “Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.” If you make the easy choices right now, your overall life will be a lot harder. Your body saying it’s cold is different than your mind saying it’s cold. Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind. Choiceless Awareness, or Nonjudgmental Awareness. Life-hack: When in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep meditation or fall asleep. Victory either way. “The Attraction for Drugs Is Spiritual.” I just want to be the most successful version of myself while working the least hard possible. Applied science becomes technology, and technology is what separates us from the animals and allows us to have things like cell phones, houses, cars, heat, and electricity. The returns in life are being out of the herd. Mathematics is us reverse engineering the language of nature, and we have only scratched the surface. Courage is not caring what other people think Understanding the long-term consequences of your actions. The democratization of technology allows anyone to be a creator, entrepreneur, scientist. The future is brighter. I read out of curiosity and interest. Forget rich versus poor, white-collar versus blue. It’s now leveraged versus un-leveraged.

Readwise is now an integral part of my personal knowledge management flow. To give a quick idea, this is the reading workflow which I use to remember what I’ve read:\n Mark highlights and take notes while reading on my Kindle. Export highlights and notes from Readwise to Obsidian(The software I use for personal knowledge management). Review highlight and notes using Obsidian for further research and drafting book note articles. Use Daily highlights and ‘Mastery’ feature on Readwise daily for actively recalling important insights from books I’ve read. Write a book note on the website from the data from Obsidian after one month.  Why I like Readwise? As I have mentioned earlier, Readwise is a part of my knowledge management workflow. My favourite features of Readwise are the Mastery and daily highlights using spaced repetition and active recalling. Some features of Readwise which I personally think are the best are mentioned below.\nDaily Highlights Everyday Readwise sends an email with your highlights from books, articles or other sources of information you have synced. I have set this to arrive in my inbox daily at 9 AM. It helps me to passively remember small snippets of information from my favourite books. For example, last week I was surprised when I recalled one idea from James Clear‘s book Atomic Habitswhich I had totally forgotten. Ever since I started using Readwise in April, I’ve religiously read and reviewed all Readwise’s daily highlights.\nMastery The Mastery option in Readwise helps to convert any passive highlight to an active highlight by providing the option for reviewing it. Readwise converts highlights into digital flashcards that utilize active recall and spaced repetition for optimum retention.An example of Cloze Deletion from one of my highlights.Cloze Deletionis a fancy term for ‘Fill in the blank’. With cloze deletion feature you can hide any keyword or phrase of the highlight giving an opportunity to pause and think about the word.The question and answer option of mastery allow to add a question and answer for any relevant highlight. This is not automated and is useful for important highlights meant to be mastered in the long run.\nOnce any highlight is reviewed using active recall, Readwise prompts you to select how often you want to review the highlight. This is an excellent feature and helps in prioritizing highlights which matters the most.\nTagging Highlights tagged as memory from Sapiens.Readwise has a native tagging feature for organising your highlights spread across multiple topics. It also has an inline tagging feature that allows users to create tags while using Kindle. Inline tags can be created on Kindle by adding notes while highlighting using the form .[tagname]. For example, if you want to create a tag for productivity, add a note with ‘.productivity’. This is very useful when you are researching a particular topic and want to find your notes and highlights from the books you’ve read.\nExporting Atomic Habitsexported from Readwise to Obsidian in markdown format.Option to export your highlights and notes especially in markdown language is very useful for me since Obsidian is also based on markdown. I export my highlights from a book in markdown format and import them to Obsidian for further research. Readwise also allows you to export your highlights to a CSV file, Notion, Evernote and more formats.\nIs Readwise for You? I have been using Readwise for 2 months now and it is one of those subscriptions which I pay happily every month. You can now create an account on Readwise using my linkfor free(I get 30 days when you signup) and get 60 days free trial to evaluate the service. But if you’re not using Kindle or do not create enough highlights, I won’t recommend Readwise to you. Readwise gets better every day once you sync enough highlights and you do those micro-configurations required. The habit of creating highlights and notes is essential for using this service.\n","permalink":"https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/readwise-review/","summary":"My Current Reading Flow Readwisehas many features which personally helped me a lot to remember what I’ve read.

The book completely changed me and my thought process of sharing stuff online. I’m now more comfortable putting my thoughts online and having more confidence in talking about my work in public. As said earlier, I started this blog inspired by this book and became a keen follower of Austin’s blog. In fact the newsletter I run on this blog, ‘10+1 Things‘ was also inspired by his newsletter. Currently, I’m reading Austin’s other book titled, ‘How to Steal like an Artist\nKeynotes  Sharing your thoughts, processes and work online for free does better than you can imagine. Think of your website as a machine for self-discovery. Being an amateur is one of the greatest things and you don’t need to be an expert to share your work. Never wait to become an expert to show your work (This has happened many times with me). It’s all about taking that first step and just doing it. Sharing your work online actually attracts a tribe who care about or connect with the stuff you are working on. This audience would be interested in your thoughts and the process you followed for the project.- Document everything you have done using photos, notes, videos, etc.  Favorite Quotes My Kindle Highlights  Great Ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals – artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers- who make up an “ecology on talent.” “In the beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities,” said Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki. “In the expert’s mind, there are few.” The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something Even for professionals, the best way to flourish is to retain an amateur’s spirit and embrace uncertainty and the unknown. Obituaries are like a near-death experience for cowards. Reading about people who are dead now and did things with their lives makes me want to get up and do something with mine. But whatever the nature of your work, there is an art to what you do, and there are people who would be interested in that art, if only you presented it to them in the right way. Overnight success is a myth. Whether you share it or not, documenting and recording your process as you go along has its own rewards: You’ll start to see the work you’re doing more clearly and feel like you’re making progress. Once a day, after you’ve done your day’s work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of the process that you can share. If you’ve just completed a project, show the final product, share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned. Don’t think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine. “Dumpster diving” is one of the jobs of the artist- finding the treasure in other people’s trash, sifting through the debris of our culture, paying attention to the stuff that everyone else is ignoring, and taking inspiration from the stuff that people have tossed aside for whatever reasons. All it takes to uncover hidden gems is a clear eye, an open mind, and a willingness to search for inspiration in places other people aren’t willing or able to go. Don’t feel guilty about the pleasure you take in the things you enjoy. Attribution is all about providing context for what you’re sharing: what the work is, who made it, how they made it, when and where it was made, why you’re sharing it, why people should care about it, and where people can see some more work like it. Don’t share things you can’t properly credit. Find the right credit, or don’t share. “Personal stories can make the complex more tangible, spark associations, and offer entry into things that might otherwise leave one cold.” If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller. ” Once upon a time, there was __\\__. Every day, ___\\_. One day, ______\\_.Because of that, ___\\__. Untilll finally,_____” “A character wants something, goes after it despite opposition(perhaps including his own doubts), and so arrives at a win, lose, or draw.” A good pitch is set up in three acts: The first act is the past, second act is the present, and the third act is the future. “Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful.” “Make people better at something they want to be better at.” We all have to get over our “starving artist” romanticism and the idea that touching money inherently corrupts creativity. When you feel like you’ve learned whatever there is to learn from what you’re doing, it’s time to change course and find something new to learn so that you can move forward.

In fact, the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/history-of-blogging\u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer noopener\u0026quot; title=\u0026quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/history-of-blogging\u0026quot;\u0026gt;early days of blogging\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; were indeed to document your life and write about the happenings in everyday life.\r\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;h2 class=\u0026quot;has-large-font-size\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#ba0c49\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;has-inline-color\u0026quot;\u0026gt;3.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; Writing as a Skill\r\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\rI have always struggled to write. I remember my Post-Graduate days when I used to struggle writing my 3000 words assignments. Blogging can improve your writing skills and it changes your perception. It also improves your skill of conveying thoughts or ideas into words. Writing is one skill that I aim to improve by the end of this year.\r\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;h2 class=\u0026quot;has-large-font-size\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#ba0c49\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;has-inline-color\u0026quot;\u0026gt;4.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; Building a Community\r\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\rOne of my dreams is to build a community of people with whom I share the same values and perceptions of life.
