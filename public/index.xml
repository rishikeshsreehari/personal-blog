      <description>The Experiment The Man from the Future is a thought experiment that I‚Äôve been exploring over the years to understand the basics of everything we‚Äôre experiencing today ranging from food to our gadgets. Human history is quite fascinating and the pleasures we‚Äôre enjoying today has been achieved through multiple iterations of science, technology or culture, built upon the knowledge of past generations. The first principle‚Äôs thinking and Thomas Thwaites‚Äôs Toaster Project had a great influence on this thought experiment.</description>

      <description>Anamaria Luga in Beyond on Curator Economy
The Boom of Creator Economy With the rising popularity of social media and the internet, the creator economy is at an all-time high. In 2021 alone, the creator economy has seen a record funding of $1.3 billion. The cost of creating content continues to go down as more content creators are appearing online. The shift of content creation from big corporations to independent small creators around the globe has resulted in an age where we are overloaded with the vast availability of information.</description>

      <description>Efficiency Scoring of an Idea Since human beings are hacking evolution, all inefficient things are in the past and efficient things are in the future. Wealth is generated when businesses help humans from point A to point B in a more efficient manner. This theory can be used to test an idea or an existing business. The efficiency score of a business solution or approach can be represented on a scale of 1-10 by the amount of efficiency it creates.</description>

My primary means of information consumption was through my laptop and I used my phone to consume content only while travelling or during unavoidable circumstances. Following are some steps, and tips that I followed in the Boring Phone framework such that I‚Äôm less addicted to my smartphone.</description>

      <description>The Thought Experiment Warren Buffet explains the concept with a thought experiment when a Genie appears 24 hours before you were born. The genie gives you the wish that you determine the economic and social system into which you are going to emerge. There is a catch though as you do not have any control over where you would be born. If you play the lottery, you do not know whether you‚Äôre going to be:</description>

      <description>Importance of Single Purpose Devices To start with, a single-purpose device is a device that serves only one purpose or function. On the contrary, the smartphone is a multipurpose device that serves many functions. The problem with multipurpose devices like a smartphone is a distraction. Imagine you‚Äôre trying to read on your smartphone and suddenly you‚Äôre distracted by notification and the flow is lost. Even though there are many multipurpose devices in our lives, nothing has penetrated into our lives like a smartphone.</description>

      <description>The Triggers Let‚Äôs not blame marketers, it is their job to promote products and force us to buy. Over the years marketers have mastered various techniques that force consumers to impulse purchase products. Some techniques have evolved over time as in recent times there was a drastic shift in shopping patterns with the rising popularity of e-commerce sites. But underlying psychology remains the same and today every app that has something to sell is fighting for our attention, forcing us to buy stuff.</description>

      <description>In a nutshell, zone 2 training involves training at a low-intensity level for a longer period of time. The goal of zone 2 training is to sustain an intensity for longer periods of time such that heart rate lies in the range of 60-70% of the maximum heart rate value. Training at this intensity is incredibly easy and boring at the same time. When I started zone 2 training, I was a bit sceptical as it seemed too easy and I always had the attitude of ‚Äògo hard or go home‚Äô when it comes to training.</description>

Organic Farming might sound sustainable and fancy, but it is not practical to use it to feed the rising population. Also, it is quite unsustainable considering the amount of land it uses. Learning doesn‚Äôt end in school and is a lifelong process. Self-learning is key in the 21st century.</description>

When instant cake mixes were introduced in the 1950s to simplify life, American housewife was reluctant to buy them. It made cooking easy. Manufacturers had to change the recipe to add an egg to improve sales. Subway is popular because it gives people the feeling that they are making their own sandwich and it allows for customization. People are ready to pay a premium for apple plucking even though the actual cost of apples are less.</description>

Our history books include few women, so subconsciously since we are young, men are our first thought when we consider brilliant people. Because of this underrepresentation, STEM careers that often need brilliance have fewer women employed. Many studies have indicated that women often suffer from impostor syndrome, which prevents them from pursuing STEM careers since brilliance is often seen as a male characteristic. A 2018 study surprisingly found that people were 40% less likely to refer a woman for a job that required high levels of brilliance.</description>

What is an Attention Diet? An Attention Diet is to be followed in the 21st century, an era where we are bombarded with information. Attention diet focuses on the amount of media, content and socializing people are doing these days, eventually distracting themselves. The goal of an attention diet is to find highly nutritious sources of information and relationships to build our lives around them. The diet gives more importance to quality over quantity.</description>

How does it work? How an entry looks in Resonance Journal
The concept is simple. Every time you come across a video, podcast, job, article, book, project, etc that resonates with you, add it as an entry to the resonance journal. Use the existing tags or create one if it doesn‚Äôt exist. Over time you would see a pattern or a common thread of things that resonates with you.</description>

I have always struggled to start. Being a person who cares a lot about design and aesthetics, I usually spend a crazy amount of time tweaking things to launch the perfect product. When I started 10+1 Things, I decided that I‚Äôm gonna start anyway irrespective of the design or clarity. If you check the initial few issues in the archive, you can see that the style was different and not uniform.</description>

The idea of a stress journal is simple. Any time you face anxiety or stress, write the date and write about the feeling and what triggered it. I usually give it a score out of five¬†to indicate how much it bothers me. Every time I open the journal to write a new entry, I go through all the previous entries. I cross out entries that don‚Äôt bother me anymore.</description>

This book is a must-read if you are looking to get some insights on diet and leading a healthy diet.
How the book has changed me? As mentioned earlier many ideas were already known to me. But the book brought more clarity to my notion against processed food. The French Paradox mentioned in the book was also thought-provoking. The practice of having a colourful diet backed up with the idea of phytochemicals was new to me.</description>
