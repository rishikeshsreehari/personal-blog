Features Publication Dates are not important to Digital Gardeners. Posts are connected via references or common themes. There are no featured posts or chronological list of items. Readers can enter through any note, follow any trail and exit as they wish. Digital Gardens are constantly evolving over time and are never complete. There is no pressure to publish a perfect post in digital gardens as notes grow over time just like plants in a garden.</description>
