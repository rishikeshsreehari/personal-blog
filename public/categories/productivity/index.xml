      <description>The idea was to ensure that I consume as less information as possible via my smartphone and reduce as many triggers that force me to pick up my phone.

      <description>Importance of Single Purpose Devices To start with, a single-purpose device is a device that serves only one purpose or function. On the contrary, the smartphone is a multipurpose device that serves many functions. The problem with multipurpose devices like a smartphone is a distraction. Imagine you‚Äôre trying to read on your smartphone and suddenly you‚Äôre distracted by notification and the flow is lost. Even though there are many multipurpose devices in our lives, nothing has penetrated into our lives like a smartphone.</description>

Over the years marketers have mastered various techniques that force consumers to impulse purchase products. Some techniques have evolved over time as in recent times there was a drastic shift in shopping patterns with the rising popularity of e-commerce sites.

How does it work? How an entry looks in Resonance Journal
The concept is simple. Every time you come across a video, podcast, job, article, book, project, etc that resonates with you, add it as an entry to the resonance journal. Use the existing tags or create one if it doesn‚Äôt exist. Over time you would see a pattern or a common thread of things that resonates with you.</description>

The idea of a stress journal is simple. Any time you face anxiety or stress, write the date and write about the feeling and what triggered it.

I cross out entries that don‚Äôt bother me anymore.</description>
