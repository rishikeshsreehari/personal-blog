This book is a must-read if you are looking to get some insights on diet and leading a healthy diet.
How the book has changed me? As mentioned earlier many ideas were already known to me. But the book brought more clarity to my notion against processed food. The French Paradox mentioned in the book was also thought-provoking. The practice of having a colourful diet backed up with the idea of phytochemicals was new to me.</description>

      <description>How the book changed me? The life philosophy of Naval resonates with me a lot and this book strengthened it. The ideas and his vision towards his life had a huge impact on me and this book would be one the best books I’ve read. His view on judgement and leverage have been very influential to me. This is one book that I revisit a lot many times a year.</description>

      <description>How the book changed me? The book completely changed me and my thought process of sharing stuff online. I’m now more comfortable putting my thoughts online and having more confidence in talking about my work in public. As said earlier, I started this blog inspired by this book and became a keen follower of Austin’s blog. In fact the newsletter I run on this blog, ‘10+1 Things‘ was also inspired by his newsletter.</description>
