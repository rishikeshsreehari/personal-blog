How does it work? How an entry looks in Resonance Journal
The concept is simple. Every time you come across a video, podcast, job, article, book, project, etc that resonates with you, add it as an entry to the resonance journal. Use the existing tags or create one if it doesnâ€™t exist. Over time you would see a pattern or a common thread of things that resonates with you."><meta name=author content="Rishikesh"><link rel=canonical href=https://jade-sable-e0c36b.netlify.app/resonance-journal/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.2e18a2af17a880473d263a3c6581e1c4ba7a9800c5a33aa59d7f2ce80844223b.css integrity="sha256-LhiirxeogEc9Jjo8ZYHhxLp6mADFozqlnX8s6AhEIjs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.acb54fd32bbc1982428b8850317e45d076b95012730a5936667e6bc21777692a.js integrity="sha256-rLVP0yu8GYJCi4hQMX5F0Ha5UBJzClk2Zn5rwhd3aSo=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
